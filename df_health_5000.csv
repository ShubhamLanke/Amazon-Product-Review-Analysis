That household cleaner wasn't a fluke, folks, this Charlie really knows his stuff!  After using Charlie's Soap laundry detergent, I stacked towels in the linen closet and noticed immediately that I could tell which had been washed in the old detergent and which had been washed in Charlie's Soap -- the Charlie's Soap towels were noticeably softer.I use this for everything now:  I reconstitute it with a bit of water and use it as a degreaser in my kitchen and barbeque grill.  I use it in a spray bottle as a prespotter for laundry, and I've used it with my steam cleaner/extractor for my carpets.The only thing that exceeds my happiness with this product is when folks I've recommended it to come back to me and say, ""You were absolutely right about Charlie's Soap -- it's awesome!

50928,A3SF716LKI8GXB,B000G647Y8,Lban,0,0,"I used this product to shave my head for over a year now.  I'll agree with most the reviews here that it sheds a bit in the beginning.  Mine must have been special since it shed for over 6 months and had suddenly stopped.  I have it 4 stars vs 5 stars because of the prolonged shedding.  I was just about ready to throw it in the trash when it decided to stop.This is my only shave brush so I can't give you a comparison.  What I will say is that I don't like applying shaving cream or any shave lubricator without a brush now.  Feels too messy now that I've been using a brush for so long.I was using shave soap but have since switched to shampoo with my shave brush and I have literally shaved off 15 minutes of my groom time.  Here are a list of my pros and cons of the brush.Pros:Great applicatorKeeps hands clean(er)Ornamental addition to your shave collectionCons:Shedding*Shampoo technique--same as using shaving soap.  I place a small amount in my shaving bowl, foam and apply.  For shaving my head, I leave the bowl not too thick of foam and do the most of the foaming part on my head which keeps the foam wet longer and also exfoliates.  Foaming with shampoo also has the hairs all sink to the bottom so I can rinse my hands or razor without parting the sea of floating gunk.  Furthermore, my razor doesn't clog up as much and rinses out with only 2-3 swishes--no tap required.  Shave soap required 4-5x more plus tapping on sink.",4.0,Shed hair for a while and has since stopped,1368921600,"05 19, 2013"
78333,A2XM1C766VYUAG,B000QYEK88,Charles Roderick,0,0,"I had never used a double edge (DX) razor before although my father and uncles used one. For some reason I was afraid of the DE razor; it looked as if one could cut oneself badly.  I went to YouTube and found a few videos demonstrating &#34;how to&#34; shave using a DE. One video had the instructor shaving a five (5) day old beard, which by the way came off like a hot knife through butter.I summoned my courage and tried the DX razor.  For a moment while shaving for the first time, I thought that the razor did not work; I didn't feel a thing, i.e. there was no &#34;tug or pull&#34; of the DE blade on your facial hair. For a &#34;brief&#34; moment I thought that there wasn't any blade in the Merkur. Wow, I can't describe the feeling of shaving with the Merkur Duty Double Edge razor. It is simply the best shaving appliance that I have ever used!In retrospect I cannot believe that I had been denying myself a great shaving experience all these years.  I don't say this lightly but do yourself a favorite a try &#34;any&#34; double edge razor and see for yourself that it provides the closest and most comfortable shave that you had had.By the way, did I mention that the cost of a DE blade is approximately 15 % of the cost of a Gillette cartridge and gives you twice as many shaves?",5.0,Denying Pleasure to Yourself All these Years,1395100800,"03 18, 2014"
231824,A1WPFIZ8P3O86V,B004PJ3ECS,"Phil in Magnolia ""Phil-i-am""",0,0,"I recently ordered replacement pads for ourEureka Enviro Hard-Surface Floor Steamer, model 313A. The pads that came with the steamer were completely worn out, and I had tried usingBakers & Chefs Bar Moptowels as a lower cost replacement (the bar mops can be folded over and are the right size when that is done), but the towels are a much thinner fabric and do not have the same reinforcement on the sides plus they cannot held tightly enough to stay stretched and fit properly. As a result they fold over when used with the steamer and in my experience were not suitable. (I tried them because one of the top reviews to the 313A floor steamer suggested it).There are two choices that I found on Amazon for replacement pads, and I ordered both:-Genuine Eureka Deluxe Magic Cloth for Eureka Enviro Steamer 313A (Set of 2 Cloths)(product on this page) - two pads for $14.25 plus tax, with prime shipping included and sold by Amazon (that is what I paid in March 2014, but the pricing can vary on Amazon). These come in a clear plastic package with no product identification whatsoever. The Amazon product page states that they are produced by Eureka; I received them packaged in a box with only a very small barcode tag indicating Eureka, and the tags on the cloths indicate only the content of the pads and do not state Eureka.-Eureka Enviro 60978 Pads 2pk- two pads for $9.99 plus tax, with prime shipping included, sold by Amazon. These come in a simple plastic package with only a small cardboard label, very similar to what is shown on the Amazon product page, indicating that they are produced by Crucial Vacuum.All of the pads that I received - two of each as indicated above - were identical to what came with the Eureka steamer when I purchased it, and they fit fine and work the same.The pads from Crucial Vacuum (see second link above) were about 30% less expensive than the 'Eureka' pads, and since they are identical, I think that they are the clear choice and better value.",3.0,These are the OEM pads and work well; you can also get the Crucial Vacuum replacement pads and save up to 30%,1396569600,"04 4, 2014"

According to spec, four alkaline batteries can last up to 300 uses when used 6 times a day.  It also include an AC adapter the size of a cellphone adapter.  It is rated 100V to 240V so you can travel and use it out of the country if you want where voltage is  220V.  It includes also a nylon case for storage.I remember my sister who is a nurse, used to carry a blood pressure monitor with liquid glass tube that contain toxic metal mercury.  It was heavy and needs a stethoscope to hear your pulse.  I tried it and it was so difficult and complicated.  With this kind of monitor, anybody can use it, thus you don't have to be a doctor or a nurse.  All you need to know is what is the normal blood pressure for you (which a doctor can help you determine), then you can compare it with your readings from home.  You just put the batteries, plug the cuff, wrap it around your arm, press the On button, and wait.  After less than a minute, it will give you your systolic and diastolic readings.  The digital readings are large and easy for challenged eyes. It will even give you your pulse rate and alert you for irregular heartbeat.TruRead mode - will automatically perform 3 consecutive readings and give you the average for more accurate result.If you are currently monitoring your blood pressure, it has an internal memory to store 100 readings.  It can do that for 2 individual persons.  A guest mode is available so other people can use the monitor without affecting the stored memory for people that are doing constant monitoring.Also if you are monitoring, the first thing you should do is to adjust the time and date.  The button on the bottom left will do that, it cycles to year, month, date, hour, seconds for easy setup.The arm cuff is pre-formed into a circle.  It can adjust to small to bigger arms and can be secured in a wrap with a Velcro.Made in China.Make sure to read the included manual to determine the best time to take your blood pressure.  Do not move and make sure you relax your arm when taking a reading.  Rest for at least 15 minutes before taking a reading.  Make sure the arm is not constricted with a tight fitting sleeve or clothes.  Avoid eating, drinking alcohol, exercising, smoking and bathing 30 minutes before taking your measurement.",4.0,"So simple, so easy to use.",1300838400,"03 23, 2011"

It is good for cleaning under the rim of the toilet, but does nothing to clean the accumulation (brown algae, etc.) in the scratches left behind by the wire core brushes the supermarkets carried.  Even using blue tank tablets and scouring powder does not clean the scratches.  They look terrible, and I may have to buy a new toilet.

18813,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B00024CUMK,Andrea Polk,169,189,"After using Rainbow Light's Women's 'One' vitamin supplement for over a year, I'm sold on it.  I've tried many other brands of vitamins designed specifically for women, but no others have been so easy to digest (with or without food) and so complete.  Yes, they are BIG pills, but you only take one a day and can break it in half if you need to do so.  Loaded with good stuff that includes a vegetable juice complex, women's nourishing blend and complete digestive support (probiotics), in addition to a well-balance multivitamin.NOTE: This women's multivitamin is tough to beat as it's only taken once a day and maximizes many of the recommended daily values, however most women will want/need to supplement with additional calcium as that is the one area where based upon the daily recommended values, it is lacking.**Other Rainbow Light Multivitamins are offered on this Amazon page, but this review is only for Rainbow Light Women's One.**Included in this multivitamin are the following: (taken directly from the product packaging)Vitamin A, 5000 IU - 100% recommended daily valueVitamin C, 120mg - 200%Vitamin D, 800IU - 200%Vitamin E, 100IU - 333%Vitamin K, 100mcg - 125% **not found in all multivitamins.Vitamin B-1, 25mg - 1667%Riboflavin (B-2), 25mg - 1471%Niacin, 25mg - 125%Vitamin B-6, 25mg - 1250%Folic Acid, 800mcg - 200%Vitamin B-12, 25mcg - 417%Biotin, 150mcg  - 50%Vitamin B-5, 25mg - 250%Calcium, 200mg - 20% **additional supplement needed.Iron, 6mg - 33%Magnesium, 100mg - 25%Zinc, 10mg - 25%Selenium, 200mcg - 286%Copper, 1mg - 50%Manganese, 2mg - 100%Chromium, 200mcg - 167%Molybdenum, 75mcg - 100%Choline, 20mgInsitol, 20mgBoron, 1mgCitrus Bioflavonoid Complex, 25mgWomen's Nourishing Blend: 125mg which includes Dong Quai root extract, Organic Spirulina, Red Clover blossom extract.Vegetable Juice Complex: 10mg which includes Kale, Spinach, Dandelion Greens and BeetsComplete Digestive Support: includes Protease, Amylase, Lipase, Cllulase and Lactobacilus.Betaine HCL, 10mgGuaranteed 100% natural, this vitamin contains no dairy/lactose, sugar, wheat, yeast or gluten.In conclusion, this is one vitamin supplement that has made a positive difference in my life and I will continue to take it - recommending it to other women, especially those who are perimenopausal, have fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome or other energy zapping woes.UPDATE: July 25, 2011I did the unthinkable and tried another product for 3 months, but am now going back to Rainbow Light.  The other:GNC WOMEN's Ultra Mega 90 Capletsdid nothing for me in terms of energy or immune system boosting, and left me wondering why I'd paid good money for 'ultra mega'.  Must have liked the name... and had a moment of weakness in the GNC store looking for Rainbow Light!Currently I'm takingRainbow Light Women' s Nutritional System  Multivitamin Supplement  Food Based  Tablets  180 tablets, which has EVEN MORE of the good stuff in this vitamin with complete digestive support and 'balance and vitalizing blend'. 1200mg of Calcium...120% of your daily dose with this one means no calcium supplement needed. Higher in 'C' and some others too.I made the shift back to Rainbow Light and don't intend to ever make the mistake of leaving them again, but chose to give this one a shot because I'm in need of the 'hormone balancing' herbs.  Yes, I've hit perimenopause and according to the Rainbow Light website, this is the vitamin they recommend for me.The upside - no stomach upset with or without food and the pills are about half the size of this one.  The bad... the recommended serving per day is 6 tablets.  Yes, more expensive and inconvenient, but truthfully if the 'hormone balancing' works - I'd take darn near anything 6 times a day.  Right now I'm only on week 3 of taking them and not sure if they'll be better for me than 'one', but I'm optimistic.  I trust the brand and the thought that goes into each formulation.  If you're having similar issues go to the Rainbow Light website and take their questionare to see which formula is recommended for you.UDATE: 7/16/12 - A few people have commented that this review contains product info that's not on their bottle of Rainbow Light.

Later discovered I had a deviated septum and a minor bent nose.I started my nose spray addiction because quite frankly, it worked for me. I could breathe again. Well, I came to the realization I was addicted to this, so I went to a ear, nose, throat specialist and decided to have something done about my deviated septum.Turns out the septosplasty didn't do all that much for me. Could be partly my fault. I had stints in my nose after the surgery that were suppose to be in for three days after the surgery. As soon as I came home from the surgery, I sneezed and one of them came out.Anyway, I came back from the surgery having breathing problems again and back to my favorite costco version of Afrin. Wanting to exercise my will against this addiction, I decided to go cold turkey and go for it. Well, as of writing this it has been 1 week off of nose spray which I can not tell you how long its been since I didn't use nose spray. This ""Simply Saline"" has helped me because whenever I started feeling my nose was getting swelled, I would spray it in.

I prefer the texture of Scott bath tissue so for me this product was really not bad at all. I enjoy knowing that I am helping to keep our planet ""green"" when choosing this bath tissue.This bath tissue is made of completely recycled paper--80% of which is post consumer material! Great! All this DOES reduce pollution, just as they advertise on the wrapping of the roll of toilet paper. The wrapping is great and the bath tissue is whitened without using bleach. I am very impressed. Predictably, this bath tissue is not just kinder to Mother Nature; it's easier on those of us who are sensitive to scents. It is hypoallergenic; and it is perfectly safe for toilet and septic systems just as Amazon notes above. Of course, there's always a limit to how much paper will go in one single flush down the toilet; but most people have an intuitive sense about this so it shouldn't be a problem.Of course, bath tissue never ""goes stale,"" so if you catch a sale on this product stock up on it! The rolls can be stored in the package they come in; or you can store the rolls individually in various places throughout your home where they will be needed.Actually, there are some concerns. Seventh Generation bath tissue is comparatively expensive to most other brands of bath tissue. People on a budget may simply not be able to afford this product. Moreover, some people will protest the feel of this paper since, as I wrote above, it's not exactly Charmin soft. I'll take off one star for these two issues even though I personally like this very much.

Because of my age, my doctor recommends that I take 1,200 mg. of calcium per day.  At least according to Vitamin World, where I buy most of my vitamins, that much calcium cannot be utilized at one time; so, it was advised that I take 600 mg. twice a day.  Also, the type of calcium is considered important; calcium citrate is more easily absorbed than calcium carbonate.  I had some questions, so I called the toll free number:  1-800-433-2990, and received these answers:1.  What are percentages of calcium carbonate versus citrate? It is a blend, so they cannot say, although since the calcium carbonate is listed first, it would be the predominant ingredient.2.  Timed release over what period of time? It releases over a 6 to 8 hour period.3.  ""Discontinue use and consult your doctor if any adverse reactions occur.""

The representative advised that individuals should consult with their doctors or pharmacists before taking this product to assess the compatibility with existing medical conditions or prescriptions.The other aspect I liked about this product, because I do not take a multivitamin, is that it has other added elements such as Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, copper and manganese.

The verdict is in: a GREAT product and works as seen in the commercial.After removing dog hair and other debris, you simply wash off the roller with warm water, blot on a lint-free paper towel, and you are good to go again.Important Note: Resist any tendency to ""pull or pick at"" any portion of the sticky part of the roller.You will save a small fortune in lint rollers, as all three rollers may be used over and over again.We are completely satisfied.

303104,A3OJX18B60PJR9,B00AV5K7TI,"DAVERAT ""daverat""",0,0,"UPDATED 12/06/13: Better than other bargain brands but I want my REAL Bounty:  I gave this a shot due to a coupon incentive from Amazon that brought the price down enough to make me consider changing from the top-of-the-line Bounty.  Unfortunately, the savings doesn't work out when you consider how many MORE sheets it takes to do the same amount of cleaning both indoors and on the car.  These Basic Bounty towels DO offer the same conveneience of Select-a-Size BUT they tear easily &  just FAIL the scrub test.  To use our fave Alien's wise comment on price.. remember what Paul's quote is in the moviePaul [HD] regarding that Ninja sword Cilve wants to buy for cheap: it's just another example of ""False Economy"" - it may SEEM like you are getting MORE for your money or the same thing for LESS money, but in the end... you get a weaker quality product and will have to use much more of it to achieve the desired result. In the end,  you save nothing by the switch.  In the long run, I'll  be sticking with Bounty's top of the line variety because what isn't broken doesn't need to be fixed in MY CASE.  Other people may already be using a lower teir product and to them, I have something to say:I've tried many brands of economy towels in a search for something cheap and workable. In the end, none of them really hold up to Bounty's Premium brand product because it's about as good a product as you can get, especially with the seleclt-a-size option. If like me, you were hoping to save a little cash and try out their lower tier product, don't bother.  Instead,  wait for sales and buy in BULK!  When you do that, you can often get Bounty premium at the same price as this lower level variety.  You just have to PLAN OUT your household paper purchases in advance.  It's not something I've always done, & I know it's something you have to get used to but it works. Last year my wife bought the huge Quilted Northern or Charmin Toilet paper deal here on Amazon & I was shocked by how much we saved by buying 4 huge mega cartons of TP at once.  ""Where to store it?"" was the only downside, but once we found some clever places to stow it away, we noticed the difference of not having to run out and buy a 12 pack or so every couple of weeks.  If, however,  you're loking to make an upgrade from a bottom tier Paper towel.. Bounty basic might just fit the bill for you in more ways than one:If you are using a store brand's budget towel - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS!  Your explectations are already  pretty low & if you've been buying stuff a step or 2 down from even VIVA, then this will make your life in the kitchen and bathroom instantly less of a hassle!  Really, Bounty Basic is LEAGUES BETTER than Grocery Store brand towels.  the Select-a-Size will also help you save on the # of towels used.  I have occasionally had very little cash in my pocket and/or forgot my debit card on a quick run to the store which necessitated the purchase of a role of the economy towels at my local market.  SO, I have tried the super cheap paper towels.  If you buy THESE  Bounty BASIC towels IN BULK and with any offers of added Savings like Subscribe & Save, this WILL be a VAST improvement over THOSE bottom-of-the-barrell towels & only slightly more expensive.  Since ONE of these works as well as 3 sheets of the crapola towels - you WILL save money.  However, if you're like me and have gotten used to Bounty Premium's cloth-like toughness on the job and are prepared to PAY for that, stick with regular Bounty. Heck, thry them both if you are still doing the Viva route.  You may find you want the top of the line or you may just find a better basic towel than you ever knew existed.I gave this 4 stars because it is a huge step up from VIVA or generics and I realize there are a lot of people out there who might not know that this  purchase DOES work out to about the same price or even LESS if you employ all of Amazon's savings techniques, such as Subscribe & Save.  So, have a happy & clean day!  try and save a little money too!",4.0,The savings isn't enough to make up for lower performance & quality.

My son and I need haircuts every 3-4 weeks, so the dollars add up.These clippers make a lot of sense (cents? sorry). :)There's not a ton of difference between me telling the girl at Supercuts to ""use the #3 clippers on the sides and blend it on top"" versus doing it at home, except maybe the mess. These clippers surprised me though, because they don't throw the hair all over the room the way other clippers do.These clippers come with three different attachments: two for different hair lengths and one for a ""stubble"" finish. The attachments impressed me, because they were rigid enough to maintain a consistent length. I've had other trimmers where they were flimsy enough that applying pressure to the attachment would force it to cut shorter, which can be disastrous. I was also impressed with how well they clicked from setting to setting; the settings don't matter much if you can't click back to the one you want next time you use them.I was happy to see that you could clean these clippers under a running faucet. It made it a lot easier to get a good clean result when I was done.Finally, I was glad to see that I could use these clippers on my facial hair too. I don't like having different gadgets for different things, so it's nice to be able to use these clippers on my beard as well._______________________________________UPDATE:  7/19/2010I was using the trimmer this morning and thought maybe I should post an update on this review.  I still LOVE this trimmer, but the rechargeable battery has pretty much pooped out.  I'm really glad this trimmer isn't like other rechargeable devices where you can't use them and charge them at the same time.  So I just plug it in to use it...no big deal.The other thing to mention is that the combs are starting to get a little floppy, so I have to be more careful not to apply much pressure.  I scalped myself a little while trimming my beard today.  No big deal this time, because the beard grows so quickly.Bottom line...nearly a year later with LOTS of use and I still really like this product.

I was very disappointed when I first opened the package and the cloying, synthetic-smelling flowery fragrance made me sneeze.  The badger brush is just a &#34;best&#34; and not a silver tip bristle knot, but it looked thick and good for whipping up lather.  The mug is heavy and has a little knob for your hand to hold it.  The stand is clear acrylic and very sturdy. This set LOOKS great, but the performance leaves much to be desired.ALL badger brushes come from animals that are basically hunted wild in China (with licenses and a only a certain number each year taken in each season) so I expect the hair on the brush to have variation and also a little smell to it.  It's usually advised to wash the brush in shaving soap for a bit, then rinse gently and dry it out.  But this brush had a horrible animal odor to it that was mixed with a formaldehyde or solvent smell that several washes couldn't get rid of!  It was detectable over the scent of the soap (more on that horror in a bit) and lingered in my nostrils after shaving with my favorite soap.  Additionally, the brush lost a LOT of hairs (10 to 20) every time I tried to lather with it, rinse it or manipulate it in any way.  The knot is not secure enough in the handle and it shows.The soap is another sad story.  It's supposedly full of glycerin and oils, but the smell is so overpowering to me that my allergies flared up as soon as I lathered my face.  After my shave, I broke out in a rash over the places where the soap was.  I respond like that to some synthetic fragrances so I was very disappointed in the soap.  It seemed to need a LOT of work to make a good lather, too.This set is a good start but is NOT worth the money.  You are better off getting a NICE brush (I have several Edwin Jagger brushes, and they also make Crabtree&Evelyn; brushes!) and a GREAT soap like the New Proraso or even a really expensive shea butter soap bar.

There are several different varieties to choose from within the Charmin brand. This review is for the Charmin Ultra Strong toilet paper.The Charmin Ultra Strong holds up to its name. It is very strong paper. It's not soft like their Ultra Soft, it's almost a scratchy paper. It is good, quality, thick and holds up well. I prefer a softer paper like their Ultra Soft but if you're looking looking for strong paper then this is excellent.I normally review a product only. I don't normally get into price and such because many people read reviews only to find out the quality of a product then may buy it at various places and prices. Online toilet paper is a little different. You are wanting to know exactly what you'll be getting when you order this specific order of paper. It is advertised as 10 packs of the 4-count double roll packages of Charmin Ultra Strong. The individual packages themselves do not include any size information but the big outer box states that it includes 40 double rolls with 165 2-ply per roll. I did a little research and according to the data that I found, 165 sheets is a double roll for Charmin. These rolls are very small though. They are not as big as other double rolls of toilet paper that we have. They do seem very similar in size to a single roll. Price wise, this is not that good of a deal. I normally try to spend 25 cents per single roll or 50 cents per double roll or less.I like the Charmin quality. I do prefer a softer toilet paper than this Ultra Strong.

I've just written a long and detailed review on the Natren probiotic addressing this very issue:Natren Megadophilus Dairy Free, Capsules, 90-CountandNatren Healthy Trinity Dairy Free Capsules, 60-CountNatren is one of the leading probiotic manufactures, and they state their product must be refrigerated at all times in order to keep the potency to the levels guaranteed on the bottle until the date of expiry. Other companies are a little more lenient. Udo's Choice is one such company. Here is a quote from their web site:Time of Manufacture GuaranteeFlora's dating process is based on the ""time of manufacture"", which means that the bacterial count on the bottle reflects the number of bacteria in each capsule at the time it was made. The bacterial count found on Udo's Choice Probiotic labels reflects only the number of viable or active bacteria in the product. Any damaged or ineffective bacteria were not included in the count.We can assume a 2%-4% decrease per month if the product has been kept refrigerated, for example 30 billion viable cells at a 2% decrease will contain 23.5 billion viable cells after 12 months. If left at room temperature, for 30 days an encapsulated product will experience a 20%-40% decrease in bacterial count. A 25% decrease can be expected for an unrefrigerated lozenge product.Udo's Choice Probiotics boast some of the largest bacterial counts available at time of manufacture so that even by the expiry date you will still be getting all the probiotics you need for proper digestion, strong immune function & overall health.Refrigeration ensures maximum potency and stability, however Udo's Choice Probiotics can be left unrefrigerated for short periods of time, making them convenient for travel. All Udo's Choice Probiotics may be frozen to further extend shelf life.&lt;END QUOTE>As you can see, if the product is shipped relatively quickly (1 or 2-day shipping, for instance) and it not left sitting somewhere hot (like sitting in the sun on a doorstep in Texas, for instance) it should be just fine. A few days at normal ambient temperatures isn't' (according to the Udo company) going to significantly diminish the value of the product.If you are still shopping around for a good probiotic make sure the one you buy says its potency is guaranteed until date of expiry, and not simply the potency at time of manufacturer. Or if it does have a time of manufacturer guarantee (as Udo's does) do some research to find out whether they take measures to make sure the product is still potent enough by the time it gets to you. Udo's, for instance, puts a massive number of viable bacteria into each capsule so that even if some die off it is still a potent product.**** FOUR STARS ****I am giving it four stars, because I think Natren has a more advanced delivery system (such as their oil matrix). 90 to 95% of the bacteria in capsules are known to die in the stomach acids. Various methods are used to get around that, such as enteric coating. Natren has an oil matrix which is meant to also stop the bacteria competing with each other (which is apparently another issue that can diminish overall effectiveness).",4.0,Good Product.

I will give it a time and we see in 2-3 months from now how successive  this device is in hair removing ...

Forget about vaniqa and other stuff this is a real DEAL !and one more tip, if you shave a day before it works better . to close shaving may not be a good idea as flashing,  next day after shaving it sting more what mean more hair are affected , as it should do nothing on no hairy skin area, also after shaving the skin is irritated so flashing it after is not recommended , telling you from my own experiencesMarch/29/2013after 6 months I used 2 of Removal Cartridge , I have like 10% left of the hair , it was like 1 month where I did not had anything then little bit returned again but after last session they stopped growing and we see if I target them all , I believe around 1-2 months I should be free of them all, they do not bother me anymore, the hair that come back are really fine already , I am running now Cartridge number 3 , it cost me total as 1 and half laser session so still very cheap with better results , since laser did not worked for me at all due to skin reaction this was my last chance and I am glad it is working for me .I saw some comments that are not very positive but trust me after 30 days you will see not much , I use it for last 6 months and now only 1 to max 2 times per months to have peace with shaving , my unwanted facial hair was gone in the first 2 months , I have maybe 10 hair left under my arms that pop up every 2-4 weeks so that is success , I did not expected this result in 6 months and as I said before I would be ready for the summer and it seems like I will be 100% , you need to give it time and stick to the routine and timing as it is important , if you past the growing faze it will not works .

This can be done when doing something else, like watching TV, for example. Once you get the knack of it (took me less than an hour to be able to continue on autopilot, as it were) it'll feel entirely effortless, yet like with any new exercise, next day you'll feel it, your hand will hurt.

Anyway, feels great; I'm addicted.About the seller: they deliver very fast (like in three days in my experience) and the stuff is good: the balls aren't heavy, but they are weighty; the chimes sound very softly when you rotate the balls relatively fast and w/o them touching one another.

But i was so curious, that i've decided to remove my thin light hair on my arms.Here is what i did. I put the wax into the warmer and took a shower. When i was out of the shower the wax was ready to be used, but i spend a few minutes to cut the muslin strips out of the roll ( it was really smart of me to buy the whole roll and cut it, since i would need different sizes and the roll come up cheaper). I've applied some baby powder and started the process. I should note that i've never had this done by a professional, so i had a slightest idea how it should be done.And here are my conclusions:1. It was not more painful than taking out the band aid.2. It was much easier than a microwavable wax.3.It takes very little time to figure out the best way to do it.And here are my suggestions:1. If never in your life had you wax done by professionals, i'd say either go there and get it done for the 1st time or just simply but and instructional DVD for professionals and learn how to do it. I've got my on e-bay for very little, it's still on the way, but i was able do get the procedure without it anyway.2.As for the legs - it's less time consuming to remove hair with electric epilator, but if you used to shave your legs, get them waxed for the 1st time. Since hair regrows thinner it will be less painful to do it with epilator.3. Get Wax Off! - it's a very nice cream with that spa coconut smell - beautifully removes any wax from your body.4. You might want to put on the gloves - i happened to get some of the sticky wax on my fingers - i wish i would have put the gloves and wouldn't be worried about sticky fingers during the process.5. Don't worry if any wax will get anywhere on the floor or on to the furniture - that universal wax remover that would probably come with your warmer will do a beautiful job on removing it.6. I found out, that if not all wax is removed ( a little might stay around the strip), i could use that sticky strip right away and it would remove the leftovers.7. DON'T BE SCARED!Faster the move you remove the strip, less pain you will have ( as i said - Band Aid).And here we go - enjoy hair free baby skin.",5.0,Beautiful results!,1181001600,"06 5, 2007"

I gave up coffee for health reasons but also hoped it would improve the color of my teeth.  They did improve somewhat but not nearly as much as I would have liked.  I've tried the whitening toothpastes and rinses out there with negligible to average results at best.Which brings us to Crest White Strips.  When I finally bit the bullet and decided to go the whitening strip route I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  I wasn't prepared to spend the kind of money it takes to get whitening done at a dentist's office and my dental insurance doesn't cover whitening.  So Crest Strips turned out to be a great do-it-yourself alternative.I will admit that my expectations for the strips were perhaps a bit too great to start.  I was anticipating a noticeable change in three days as the package indicates.  I did see some difference but it wasn't as dramatic as I hoped.  However, after talking to friends who've used whitening strips, I decided to quit over-analyzing the process and just go with the program.  By doing so I found the end results to be very satisfactory.  Although spending 30 minutes a day with this film stuck to my teeth took some getting used to, in the end it wasn't a horrible process.I followed the regimen to the letter and after a full carton of strips, I have to say my teeth were indeed noticeably whiter.  They are still not as white as I'd like them to be, but they are certainly improved from where they were when I began using the strips.  I plan to do another regimen and see where that takes me.  If you're willing to put $50 into a whiter smile, Crest White Strips is a great choice.  I can't say how effective they are compared to other brands since I've never used them, but I am satisfied with the results I got for the price of a box of strips.

Two weeks is usually a sufficient time for me to observe my reaction to a new supplement. Before this, I was taking Nordic Naturals (1000mg) and Nature Made (1200mg). Note: The last one is not usually my first choice, but my local supermarket did have a very good sale recently, so I stocked up :P Lets compare them:Nordic Naturals (1000mg serving, you need to take 2 softgels, each one is only 500mg):EPA--330mgDHA--220mgNature Made (1200mg serving, single softgel):EPA--360mgDHA--300mgLife & Food (1400mg serving, single softgel):EPA--647mgDHA--253mgThe ratio of EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) to DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) is often overlooked. While both are vitally important, it seems that if the amount of EPA exceeds the amount of DHA in fish oil supplements, it is more beneficial in the prevention of some neurological disorders. There was a metastudy done in 2009 that found that patients taking omega-3 supplements with a higher EPA:DHA ratio experienced fewer depressive symptoms. I usually go for higher EPA:DHA ratio fish oil-it seems to work better for my migraines.Now, allow me to describe what you are getting here.The pills are pretty big, as you could probably imagine pills containing a full 1400mg serving would be. It's a consideration for some but it's really not that big of a deal-the softgels are softer than most other brands, almost like gummy bears-thus they go down pretty easy.There is a slight ""fishy"" smell to the softgels. I am actually glad that it is the case. Apart from some high-end brands that add flavoring to mask the smell, the regular trick in the industry is to coat either pills or the inside of the bottle with some chemicals that neutralize the odor. Tip: If you ever open the bottle of fish oil pills and all you can smell is a strange ""chemical odor,"" you might want to consider trying out another brand instead. I don't know about you, but I am not very keen on ingesting some unidentifiable chemicals. A slight ""fishy"" smell is good, that means there are no artificial additives.I'll have to take the company's word for the fish oil being ""Molecularly distilled, mercury free, and triple contaminant tested."" There's no way I can test for that myself. However, most commercial fish oil is put through pretty rigorous testing, both internal and independent; at this day and age, I am not really worried about contamination that much as long as I buy my product from a respectable company.The enteric coating works very well here. In case you are wondering what it is, it's a coating on a pill that is designed to dissolve not in your stomach but in the small intestine. Simply put, there are no ""fishy burps"" when taking these pills.I hope you found some of the information in this review useful. For me, high EPA:DHA ratio, no ""fishy burps,"" comparatively low price, and the fact that it's on Prime, makes it ""a buy"". I will buy another bottle when this one runs out to continue testing.

Not so with biotin. You have to be consistent, but the effects are definitely there.I've been taking it for about a year and a half now (one daily), and while it did take a while (2-3 months) to begin seeing effects, they were definitely there. The first thing I noticed was the new nail growth thickening considerably. This was very noticeable because if you looked at my nail's profile, there was a curve showing when I started taking this supplement. Eventually, the old nail grew out completely and I was left with strong, thick nails that I could actually keep long. This was quite a change from my previously thin, extremely frail nails that I could never grow out.Next thing I noticed was my hairline. Although I am young and healthy (30 years old, female), over the years my hairline had receded slightly. From what I understand, this is quite common due to the aging process and doesn't mean you're going bald or anything. Nevertheless, within a few months (3-4 months after I began taking the supplement), I noticed little tufts of hair along my temples that were making my hairstyle look messy because they kept coming untucked. I inspected pictures from when I was in my early teens and realized that those new hairs had once been part of my regular hairline!After a year and a half, I can definitely say that the effects have been quite dramatic. My hairline has filled out to its original position from when I was much younger, and my hair is definitely stronger. My nails remain thick and strong, and I have no trouble with splitting or breakage anymore. Other hair around my body seems to have been unaffected (I am naturally nearly hairless though, so not exactly a shocker), except for my eyebrows, which are now growing fierce and strong as well and need plucking a lot more often.I realize that reviews like mine are probably hard to believe from an objective point of view...

I bought a lot of the J&J; product when they came out with theirs, but it never worked as well.

72922,A1IRFAUJUS0IWY,B000O9V4CU,Lynda Dunbar,2,2,"I bought this for my husband, who suffers from chronic migraines.  His neurologist has mentioned it to him.  I did a lot of research on this before we purchased any.  Since there were multiple companies selling the PA free Butterbur, we bought 2 different ones that were different dosages.  Since the clinical research studies had shown the best results had been obtained with 75mg twice a day, we started with that one first.  When we didn't get the desired results on that we tried this one and increased his dose to 100mg twice a day.  This contained ingredients that were not in the other Butterbur we tried.  We can't say if it was the dosage or the other ingredients that were at fault, but my husbands migraines got worse while he was on this one, so we stopped it when the bottle was finished and went back to the original 75mg twice a day dose.  Migraines, as with many chronic illnesses, can have multiple triggers.  When dealing with something of that nature, finding a single and complete remedy is very difficult to accomplish.  It's best to try to figure out as many of the triggers as possible and eliminate those, then attempt to find a remedy for the remaining unknown triggers.  So our quest continues.  Sadly, this product did not work for my husband.  As for recommending or not recommending this product..... Everyone's body is different and will react differently to treatments.  Also, not everyone is going to have the same migraine triggers.

First off I should mention that I have extremely sensitive skin so when I purchased this product I expected to have minor skin irritation or a breakout during the first few uses- but that never happened! The bigmouth simply cuts through hair like butter and the wide blade can de-forest sections in seconds. It truly is that great a product.The trick is the blade actually never touches your skin. There's a small blade guard that sits a few millimeters off the blade- the guard touches your skin, the blade never does. So your first thought would be that your back would be left feeling prickly- but it doesn't. I can't explain how that bit works exactly... it simply does. The hair is removed in seconds and your back is left feeling clean and hair free. There's no stubble or irritation.As far as using the product I definitely recommend doing it dry. I've never tried it wet before (some customers apparently use it in the shower) but considering how well it works dry I see no reason to try the baKblade in the shower.

Custom upper and bottome teeth trays were molded to fit my teeth for whitening with dental grade whiteners. I found that I hated the process of whitening my teeth and ended up dreading doing it despite it working well. Eventually I tried Crest whitening strips when they came out on the market. I found that they worked just as good, though I still hated the feeling and taste of having them in my mouth. Over the years I have gone back and forth between using my personal trays and Crest Whitestrips. Honestly, I feel that the Whitestrips work just as effectively in making marked brightness in my teeth though it is more of a time commitment re: the duration of days of use required to complete a full whitening treatment. I have no idea what dentist fitted trays cost now a days, but I paid $250 for mine and they were supposed to cost twice that at the time. I think if the cost in personally fitted trays has not come down considerably then you are probably better suited to by Crest Whitestrips and hang in their for the 10 day treatment. I only whiten about twice a year. This product works very well and you will see a marked brightness in your teeth after doing the treatment for at least three days. I probably don't whiten too often because I can't stand doing it and because it does make my teeth uncomfotably tender and sensitive.

(ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00065715)SETTING: Dane County, Wisconsin.PATIENTS: 719 patients, aged 12 to 80 years, with new-onset common cold.INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 parallel groups: no pills, placebo pills (blinded), echinacea pills (blinded), or echinacea pills (unblinded, open-label). Echinacea groups received the equivalent of 10.2 g of dried echinacea root during the first 24 hours and 5.1 g during each of the next 4 days. Indistinguishable placebo tablets contained only inert ingredients.MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the area under the curve for global severity, with severity assessed twice daily by self-report using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey, short version. Secondary outcomes included interleukin-8 levels and neutrophil counts from nasal wash, assessed at intake and 2 days later.RESULTS: Of the 719 patients enrolled, 713 completed the protocol. Mean age was 33.7 years, 64% were female, and 88% were white. Mean global severity was 236 and 258 for the blinded and unblinded echinacea groups, respectively; 264 for the blinded placebo group; and 286 for the no-pill group. A comparison of the 2 blinded groups showed a 28-point trend (95% CI, -69 to 13 points) toward benefit for echinacea (P = 0.089). Mean illness duration in the blinded and unblinded echinacea groups was 6.34 and 6.76 days, respectively, compared with 6.87 days in the blinded placebo group and 7.03 days in the no-pill group. A comparison of the blinded groups showed a nonsignificant 0.53-day (CI, -1.25 to 0.19 days) benefit (P = 0.075). Median change in interleukin-8 levels and neutrophil counts were also not statistically significant (30 ng/L and 1 cell/high-power field [hpf] in the no-pill group, 39 ng/L and 1 cell/hpf in the blinded placebo group, 58 ng/L and 2 cells/hpf in the blinded echinacea group, and 70 ng/L and 1 cell/hpf in the open-label echinacea group).LIMITATION: Higher-than-expected variability limited power to detect small benefits.CONCLUSION: Illness duration and severity were not statistically significant with echinacea compared with placebo. These results do not support the ability of this dose of the echinacea formulation to substantively change the course of the common cold.PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health.",1.0,Studies indicate that echinacea does not help with colds....,1345161600,"08 17, 2012"

Tant,0,0,"This is replacing my ten year old Braun shaver - a first generation Clean and Charge shaving ""system"" (Remember the good old days when you could buy a razor without having to get some cockamamie ""system"" to go along with it?!?!??!).  While I love my Braun, it is getting hard to find the right size replacement foil/cutter block for it.  Still runs great, just can't seem to find replacement parts for it.  I therefore opted to go for a new ""system.""It works well.  I'll start with the razor itself and move on to the system.The razor doesn't use rotary blades, though the shape of the shaver itself implies that it does.  You have two banks of cutter blocks separated by a third cutting area designed to get longish hairs.  The blocks, in contrast to my old Braun, are spring-loaded, so you pretty much have to put pressure on it in order to get a close shave.  No worries, just a slight change from what I'm used to doing.  There is an angle to the shaver, and if you're used to the traditional straight-line Braun design it will take some getting used to.  That all said, it works well - shaving goes quite well once you get the knack of it.  It also runs very quietly, which my family appreciates at 6:30 am.  Lastly, while there is a trimmer, I think it's in a slightly awkward location.I'm a little more agnostic about the ""cooling"" feature.  It's a button on the shaver that makes a crossbar on the shaving head cool to the touch, ostensibly to reduce irritation.  I'm not sure about it - it just felt wet to me, but then I've been shaving so long my face is like leather - and when I first used it it felt more wet to me than cool.  The utility for others will probably be more than I got out of it, but unfortunately for me it's more gimmick than help.Now then, the system.  It comes with a charging station.  In contrast to the first generation Clean and Charge, this one charges automatically when you put the shaver in the block.  The old generation required you to manually push down a connection and then hit a button to start charging.  The block uses the same cleaning cartridges as the first gen, but they are loaded in the BACK of the stand, not the front.  This requires you to have to physically move the block in order to change cartridges.  My previous stand loaded from the front and it was very easy.  This one is a little more clumsy.As for the cleaning itself, well, I recognize that it's a way for Braun to create a revenue stream.  As I noted, I had my previous Braun for about ten years, and that's a long time for a company to go without getting more money out of me.  So I bought the cartridges, which last me about a month before replacing.  At about $8 each, that's something that had better give you some good benefit.  I'm thinking that regular use of the cartridges helped my previous shaver last as long as it has, so there's probably something to it.Really, I can't fault Braun too much though - they make stuff that lasts for years.  I'm looking forward to another decade with this shaver.",4.0,Here's hoping for another decade!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013"

While it's perhaps humorous that we're up to five blades now (I wonder how many blades razor manufacturers will stop at... six? Seven?), the extra blades DO make for a closer shave. The trimmer is a  nice touch, and it works pretty well for precision touch-ups. The conditioner also makes a big difference in the smoothness of the shave, especially for users who don't shave right after showering.The only downside is that (in my experience, at least) the blades lose their edge a little more quickly than I'd like them to. Of course, these are disposable blades, so they're not supposed to last very long, but I find that Gillette's blades tend to hold their edge a bit longer. Your results may vary.

It actually has a smaller footprint than a vacuum cleaner I have! Assembly requires attaching the upper part of the unit to the bottom part with 2 screws (Phillips head), and then sliding the handle into place.As mentioned by others, the screws can be difficult to get in place and screw down tightly. If you look at the included insert, it will show you exactly how to do it. I had to take them out and start again once.To clean carpets or rugs, simply fill the clean water container with very hot water (important for best results) to the water line and then add cleaner (included) up to the cleaner line. Set the reservoir back in place, plug it in and go.The manual says to depress the cleaning solution button and go forward slowly and then back over the same path slowly. Then release the cleaning solution button and go back over the same area slowly a couple of times. This sucks up the dirty water. You may have to go over it a couple of times until you don't see dirty water coming up into the dirty water chamber anymore. Then move to the next area and repeat. You will learn how slowly or quickly you need to go for your carpet or level of dirt.I was shocked at how much dirt came out of my rug! The water was filthy. And this is a rug in a little used room. The rug was essentially dry within a couple of hours and perfectly dry by morning.The down side to having such a compact machine is that the reservoirs are fairly small. I had to refill my cleaning solution bottle and empty the dirty water tank twice for an 8 x 10 area rug. However, it is easy to do and the smaller size fits easily in my sink, unlike my larger machines. If you have wall-to-wall carpet or a lot of rugs, you will probably be happier with a larger machine so you don't have have to empty and refill so often. But for area rugs or smaller apartments, this machine is perfect. Also, for people with less strength, this machine is easy to handle. And it absolutely cleans as well as my larger machines. Amazing!Be aware that because this is a basic, compact model, there are no attachments for cleaning upholstery. It is strictly a carpet/rug machine.When you are done, you will need to clean the brush area, which is tedious with all of these machines, but this one is a little easier to clean than my larger ones. One tip for cleaning the agitator brush area (which only comes out by unscrewing several screws) is to lift the machine up to your kitchen sink and use the sink sprayer. Cleans it out in a flash! Makes clean up after you are done sooooo much easier.The handle retracts down into the body for storage in smaller closets.I am very impressed with how well this small, lightweight machine functions and for the price, I think it's an excellent buy!Edited to add: I have since cleaned 5 or 6 other rugs and have discovered that dense-pile rugs dry much faster than rugs with shorter, less dense pile. I think this is because the cleaning solution gets into the base of the rug more easily and the machine cannot suck up the dirty water as efficiently. On the denser-pile rugs, I was able to suck up almost all the cleaning solution but one of my shorter-pile rugs held quite a bit of it. I ended up pointing a fan on that rug and it dried overnight. (It still cleaned very well and looked great afterward!)",5.0,"Unbelieveable results for such a small, light machine",1342656000,"07 19, 2012"

My physician recommended the usual NSAIDs, rest, heat to increase circulation around the shoulder muscles and tendons, and also Glutamine supplements that may help speed up recovery.  I immediately selected Jarrow Formula's L-Glutamine 750mg capsules to give it a try.For the first 15 days, I could barely lift up my left arm and there was moderate pain during the workday but intense pain when lying down or sleeping.

If you're just looking for some gradual/minor benefits (like fewer split ends) then the Jarrow is great, give it a try. But if you're really looking for noticeable difference in skin, nails, or joints, you'll have to kick it up a notch. Double or triple your dosage, or better yet, switch to Great Lakes Collagen (the green bottle, get a 1lb container for under $20).Over time, collagen supplements helps prevent wrinkles, strengthen flexibility of cartilage & tendons, has potential heart benefits, helps teeth & gums, helps digestion, helps skin heal from trauma (scabs, burns, etc), and helps nails and skin.However, if you have joint pain, either from inflammation or from worn joints (i.e., bone-on-bone grinding of knee, things like that), then you'll want a more serious dose.

287511,A1W415JP5WEAJK,B008QV2JPO,Alex S,0,0,"For several years I have used a Sunrise Alarm ClockBioBrite Sunrise Clock Advanced Model  Charcoal- It has helped me survive living on the edge of the time zone (where I had to get up before dawn twelve months a year),  early morning wake up calls to catch an airplane, and most recently getting up before dawn to help my granddaughter get on the bus. However, over time the display has faded and the clock has become less reliable. So I was glad to have the opportunity to test out this new one.The Good/Great Features -This is not a single bulb, it is multiple LED bulbs, so I no longer have to fear them burning outThe brightest light setting is actually brighter than the alarm I haveIt is truly ""blue light"" recommended for SAD as well as moodIt can be easily relocated and used as a SAD light as well as a wake up light (helping me through the mid-afternoon sleepy time)It is battery operated, meaning you NEVER have to worry that a power outage will mess you upIt can be easily angled (mine sits on my dresser) to fill the room with light instead of shining it in your eyesThis is small and portable and easy to carry along in a suitcaseThe Features I wished it had -I often used the ""dusk"" feature of my other lamp, allowing the room to grow slowly darkerIt uses a 15 minute wake up feature - which works for me, but it would be nice to have it adjustable to a longer periodThe bird chirp could be just a tiny bit louder without being jarring. I wish I could have it adjustableThe Not so Great -In order to turn the alarm off (not just turn the light off for the morning), you have to go into the menu. I use my alarm 6 days a week, it would be nice to have an easy ""on"" or ""off"" button.I can't certify as to how well this light will help you. BUT, if you have to get up while it is dark outside, I can speak to what a huge difference it makes to help me wake up enough to be able to get in a car and drive no matter how early it is.

It seems that it's time to move to a larger wedge that has more of an incline, but for early pregnancy this is great.  It's also been very good at keeping reflux down, which is yet another trial of pregnancy.  I'm sure there are other uses for it, but if you're pregnant and don't want to use a body pillow this is a good alternative for the first few months.

I almost want to buy another of these Tub Rails just so I can have one on either side of me when getting in and out of the tub! (Not that you'll need 2, just a fun idea.)Installation could not have been easier -- literally 5 minutes and I was done.  Just position it in place, tighten the clamp, and you're done!  It took more time just to get it in the house and out of the shipping box -- and waaaaaay longer than that just to research and order the darn thing!The secure and solid fit gives me 100% confidence.  If I slipped, I know this Tub Rail would be there for me, rock solid, to help catch my balance.  In fact, I bet my tub itself would buckle before this Tub Rail gave way.  This is a high quality product made with top notch steel and is very well constructed.  I can't believe it was so cheap!With a generous 300lb weight capacity, I have every confidence this thing is sturdy and is clearly built to last.  The Amazon description doesn't list the weight capacity, but if you go to the manufacturer's (Drive Medical) website, they give more detailed specs and show this Tub Rail is rated for 300lbs. (Just added a picture showing the spec sheet -- check the images above.)Rubberized grips assure the handle will never be dangerously slippery.  Even if my hand is wet, I can get a good solid grip on it.  Perfect!  And as far as I saw, this is the only Tub Rail that has the non-slip grips.  All the other one's I've seen are just painted metal, which can definitely get slippery if wet.  Even worse, other brands are made of cheap plastic -- would you honestly feel safe with that?  I wouldn't!Adjustable height clamps assure a perfect fit for just about anyone.  The clamps easily pop in and out for fast and simple height adjustments.  I have mine at the highest setting.  Most tub rails I've seen only give 12"" in height.  This one gives a whopping 17"" and I couldn't imagine using anything lower.  It's perfect!Free 2 Day Shipping -- gotta love Amazon!  Usually Amazon offers free 2 day shipping with a trial of their Prime service, but this item qualified for a different 2 day shipping offer and I'm happy it did.  I ordered this late Saturday night and it was delivered on Monday -- essentially overnight shipping -- for free!  It's no wonder I rarely shop anywhere else.Bottom Line -- I researched thoroughly, and in every respect, this is by far the best Tub Rail I found -- by a mile.  Best price, best weight capacity, adjustable height, fastest shipping, and best overall construction.  If you're in need of a Tub Rail, I doubt you'll do any better than this!",5.0,Duh!

239768,A2F4XBBGUXM19V,B004YG7LA8,"Gary A. Drury ""Techman1""",0,0,"Back when I was an early teenager AA and AAA batteries were not needed as much as today though plethora devices like a portable cassette player required them. As devices were becoming more portable carrying around batteries were not. Then one day lightening struck, I began using a clear plastic cassette tape case for my batteries. The cassette tape case was ideal for AA batteries but there was some movement which could be annoying at times. Wrapping up, it worked well, it was light, batteries were easy to access, and it was very portable and organized.Decades past and battery supplies far exceed what a clear plastic cassette tape case could handle, and using several presents that same dilemma as batteries themselves. In December of 2012 I was still on the prowl for battery storage -- especially portable battery storage for backpacking etc . . . when I found and bought these items (see the link):B007OSD9UOThey are good portable battery storage, a tremendous upgrade from my DIY make-shift clear plastic cassette tape case. They are more secure and lock together. I bought them in clear, blue, pink and green for color coding. They are light weight at a mere 0.30 ounces without batteries. Fine for home storage and short trips portable however not the complete answer for my needs and wants.Googling, Youtubing and plethora searches later I uncovered Storacell by Powerpax. I received my first purchase today of the Storacell by Powerpax slim line AAA battery caddy which holds six (6) batteries.The Storacell by Powerpax is compact, light weight at 0.40 ounces, durable, attractive, easy to use and color code, and secure. Storacell is actually smaller and thinner than the storage I provided link for. Storacell is likely as minimum as one can get for battery storage.I bought 1 Black Slim Line AAA Holds 6, 2 Orange, 1 Green AA holds 12 each, and 1 Orange which holds 1 9V, 8 AA, 4 AAA. I would really like to acquire an AAA that holds 12 like its big brother for AAs which they must not fabricate as I've been unable to locate one.These Storacell by Powerpax caddies do NOT have sharp edges so they will not catch or pluck anything when retrieving them from a pocket, backpack, luggage etc . . . . Since batteries can be insert in either direction you can chose a system that works for you. Allowing you to carry active and expired batteries in the same caddy. Example: All batteries active positive end is inserted first, when spent negative end can be inserted first so you realize it needs tossing or recharging depending on whether you use Alkaline or Rechargeables.I personally use eneloop rechargeables which are great batteries. Being somewhat anal, OCD I use a Brother P-Touch to label all my batteries with information like: date of purchase, initial charge, mAh. I was a little concerned prior to purchase that Storacell by Powerpax caddies may cause label removal. Let it be known I have NOT experienced an issue because of labeling. The eneloop batteries slide in/out normally. Granted I have only had this item in hand for several hours now but playing around with it I see no foreseeable problems.PROS:SmallCompactDurableLight WeightStrongSolid FeelPortableNo Sharp EdgesPlethora Color SelectionOne Hand Ease of UseReasonable PricingInsert Batteries are SecureProtection from Terminal End(s) DamageCONS:Batteries have little movement when insert (does NOT bother me though)AAA Battery Caddy NOT available to hold 12 (Manufacture PLEASE make some)NONE that would offer reason not to buy Storacell by Powerpax Battery Caddies.I highly recommend Storacell by Powerpax Battery Caddies.

The important components are EPA and DHA.BREAKDOWN: Here is a breakdown of these supplements.OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (See,OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, 1300 mg Enteric Burp-Free Capsule (1105 mg Omega-3/pill) 60 Capsules)*****Ethyl Esters formNot certified Kosher or Halal$28.89 for 60 1300 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1-4 gel capsPrice per gel cap = $.48 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.44 (using Amazon's price)One 1300 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 780 mgsDHA = 260 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 3 to 1Other Omega-3 = 65 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 1105 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 85%No soyNo GMOsNo cholesterolNo mercuryMolecularly distilledEnteric coatedNot vegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Phone Number: (800) 270-4010Manufactured in the U.S.A.Ingredients: pharmaceutical grade fish oil (from sustainably sourced pollock and whiting from Alaska), Kosher gelatin, glycerin, plant-derived natural food glaze (enteric coated to improve absorption and prevent burps), and mixed natural tocopherolsNutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (See,Nutrigold Triple Strength Omega-3 Gold (1,060 mg Omega-3s per softgel), 1250 mg, 180 softgels)*****Ethyl Esters formNot certified Kosher or Halal$33.78 for 180 1250 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1 gel capPrice per gel cap = $.19 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.18 (using Amazon's price)One 1250 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 750 mgsDHA = 250 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 3 to 1Other Omega-3 = 60 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 1060 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 85%Soy allergen freeNo GMOsNo cholesterolNo mercuryMolecularly distilledNot enteric coatedNot vegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Phone Number: (800) 476-3542Manufactured in the U.S.A.Ingredients: pharmaceutical grade purified fish oil (from certified sustainable wild-caught pacific cod and pollock from Alaskan waters), softgel capsule (bovine gelatin, vegetable glycerin, purified water), and natural mixed tocopherolsGarden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (See,Garden of Life - Minami MorEPA Platinum, Plus Vitamin D3 Supercritical Omega 3 Fish Oil, Orange, 30 softgels)****Ethyl Esters formNot Certified KosherCertified Halal$18.97 for 30 1218 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1 gel capPrice per gel cap = $.64 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.59 (using Amazon's price)One 1218 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 756 mgsDHA = 228 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 3 to 1Other Omega-3 = 96 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 1080 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 89%Contains soyNo GMOsNo cholesterolNo mercurySupercritical Dual-Process CO2 TechnologyNot enteric coatedNot VegetarianVitamin D3 = 300 I.U.IFOS Rating = Not ratedPhone Number: (866) 465-0051Manufactured and Encapsulated in BelgiumIngredients: pharmaceutical grade fish oil (from anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and herring), gelatin, glycerin, purified water, natural orange flavor, soy lecithin, mixed tocopherolsNorwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (See,Norwegian Gold Super Critical Omega, 30-Count)****Ethyl Esters formNot certified Kosher or Halal$25.49 for 30 1200 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1-2 gel capsPrice per gel cap = $.85 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.92 (using Amazon's price)One 1200 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 800 mgsDHA = 124 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 5 to 1Total Omega-3 = 924 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 77%Lipase = 4 mgs (fat digesting enzyme)No soyNo GMOsContains cholesterolNo mercurySupercritical Dual-Process CO2 TechnologyEnteric coatedVegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Vitamin D3 = 1000 I.U.Phone Number: (800) 830-1800Manufactured in CanadaIngredients: fish oil (from anchovies and sardines), fish gelatin, glycerin, beeswax, natural orange flavor, natural caramel color, sunflower lecithin, mixed vitamin E tocopherols (natural flavor protectors), and enteric coatingNordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (See,Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, 1,000 mg Fish Oil, 180 Soft Gels)****Triglycerides formNot certified Kosher or Halal$44.70 for 180 1000 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 2 gel capsPrice per gel cap = $.25 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.39 (using Amazon's price)One 1000 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 325 mgsDHA = 225 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 1.5 to 1Other Omega-3 = 90 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 640 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 64%No soyNo GMOsContains cholesterolNo mercuryMolecularly distilledNot enteric coatedNot vegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Phone Number: (800) 662-2544Encapsulated in the U.S.A.Ingredients: fish oil (from anchovies and sardines), softgel capsule (gelatin, glycerin, water, natural lemon flavor), d-alpha tocopherol, and rosemary extract (a natural preservative)Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (See,OMAPURE Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (1 Bottle;

The reports include a 5-star rating for each product containing greater than 60% concentration of EPA and DHA per gram of fish oil, allowing consumers to compare fish oil products based on their safety, purity and quality. Most of the highly rated omega-3 fish oil products are listed. New Chapter Wholemega is not listed or rated as a five star omega-3 fish oil product.LABEL DESCRIPTION: I am favorably impressed when a company understates its product's omega-3 content on the label. OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil typically understates its product's potency on its labels. I have seen IFOS batch test results which place OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil's omega-3 potency as high as 94%, far higher than what is stated on its label. Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil and Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega also typically understate their products' omega-3 content on their labels.POTENCY: Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (89%) has the most omega-3 potency of those in the comparison; followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (85%), Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (85%), and Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega (85%); followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (77%); followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 (75%) and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 (75%); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (72%); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (64%); and followed by New Chapter Wholemega (26%), which has the least omega-3 potency of those in the comparison.PRICE PER PILL: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.85 per gel cap) is the most expensive per pill of those in the comparison; followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula ($.64 per gel cap); followed by Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega ($.53 per gel cap); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.48 per gel cap); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.26 per gel cap); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.25 per gel cap); followed by New Chapter Wholemega ($.21 per gel cap); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.19 per gel cap); followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.15 per gel cap); and followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.13 per gel cap), which is at the least expensive per pill of those in the comparison.PRICE PER 1000 MGS OMEGA-3: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.92 per 1000 mgs omega-3)is the most expensive per 1000 mgs omega-3 of those in the comparison; followed by New Chapter Wholemega ($.79 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (.59 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega ($.50 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.44 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.40 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.39 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.18 per 1000 mgs omega-3) and Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.18 per 1000 mgs omega-3); and followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.17 per 1000 mgs omega-3), which is the least expensive per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of those in the comparison.PILL SIZE: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (1300 mgs) is the largest pill of those in the comparison; followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (1250 mgs) and Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega (1250 mgs); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (1218 mgs); followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (1200 mgs); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (1000 mgs), Now Ultra Omega-3 (1000 mgs), Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 (1000 mgs), and New Chapter Wholemega (1000 mgs); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (900 mgs); and followed by Innovix Labs Pharma-Grade Omega-3 (589 mgs), which is the smallest pill of those in this comparison. In terms of size, all of these pills are manageable for most folks.SOY CONTENT: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil, Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega, Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3, and New Chapter Wholemega do not contain soy. Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula, Now Ultra Omega-3 contain soy.GMO CONTENT: None of these supplements contain GMOs.CHOLESTEROL CONTENT: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold, Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula, Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil, Now Ultra Omega-3, Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega, and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 do not contain cholesterol. Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, and New Chapter Wholemega contain cholesterol.EPA/DHA RATIO: A high EPA to DHA ratio (more EPA than DHA) is beneficial for mood, inflammation, arthritis, heart and those concerned about their LDL cholesterol. A low EPA to DHA ratio (more DHA than EPA) is beneficial for pregnant/nursing women, children, those concerned about eyes, brain, memory, and those recovering from stroke or brain injury. DHA is mostly valuable for brain development in children 4 and under. After 5 years of age, the higher EPA portion is more important for focus, concentration, and behavior issues like ADHD.ENTERIC COATING: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, Now Ultra Omega-3, and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 are some of the few omega-3 fish oil products that are enteric coated. Enteric coating is used to prevent fish oil capsules from being digested in the stomach, which can cause a ""fishy reflux."" However, this problem is limited to only low grade, poorly manufactured fish oil products. Highly purified fish oil supplements that are manufactured to maintain freshness do not generally produce this fishy reflux, especially if the product is taken with food as recommended. Further, the only people who experience fishy burps from even high quality fish oil supplements are those with sensitive GI tract issues, for whom enteric coating may provide some relief from fishy burps, but may also interfere with absorption of the key nutrients in the supplement.There is some evidence that suggests that enteric coating is not required and may actually hinder or impede proper absorption of omega-3 fish oil. In my view, however, this body of evidence is not conclusive.Bottom line, if you have sensitive GI tract issues and experience fishy burps from omega-3 fish oil supplements, you may want to consider an enteric coated product.FISHY BURPS/ODOR: I have not noticed any fish burps or odor caused by any of these supplements, although I do not have GI tract issues so I'm probably not the best one to judge this aspect.SUPERCRITICAL DUAL-PROCESS CO2 TECHNOLOGY: Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula and Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega are not molecularly distilled. They use a proprietary Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 technology which concentrates omega-3s, yielding unique selectivity of one of the most biologically active omega-3 fatty acids - EPA. Using less heat, less repeat processing, and natural carbon dioxide as a solvent, allows these products to reach peak concentrations approximating 100% EPA, omitting superfluous fats and fillers. 400% less heat than molecular distillation is used during the entire process, with no oxygen exposure. Natural CO2 is used as an alternative to organic solvents and protects the final product from oxidation. In my opinion, Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 technology is superior to molecular distillation.VITAMIN D3: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega contains 1000 I.U. of Vitamin D3. Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula contains 300 I.U. of Vitamin D3. New Chapter Wholemega contains 50 I.U. of Vitamin D3. I don't believe this is terribly significant, as Vitamin D3 can be purchased for very little money, and lots of folks who take it consume more than 1000 I.U. daily.LIPASE: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega contains 4 mgs of Lipase, which is a fat digesting enzyme. Most omega-3 fish oil products do not contain Lipase. However, the human body produces more than adequate amounts of Lipase and, therefore, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega reference to its benefits might be somewhat enthusiastic.MEALS: Any ethyl esters based and triglycerides based omega-3 fish oils are best taken with a meal containing some fat, as they are more efficiently absorbed when taken with food.OPINION: New Chapter Wholemega is a fair product. It is soy free, it is GMO free, it is mercury free, and it is reasonably priced. On the other hand, it is not IFOS five star rated, it is not molecularly distilled, it has an extremely low omega-3 potency (26%), it contains cholesterol, it is not enteric coated, it is not vegetarian, and it is not certified Kosher.In addition, the presence of small amounts of Vitamin D3, omegas-5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and Astaxanthin do not count for much, as far as I am concerned. Some of these ingredients, like omega-6, you do not want in your supplement.  In order for the desirable ingredients like Astaxanthin to be effective, you need to take it in far greater quantities. As an example, this product contains 2.5 mcgs (that's micrograms, not milligrams; 1000 micrograms equal one milligram) of Astaxanthin. That's practically nothing. In order for Astaxanthin to be effective, you need to take between 4-12 mgs (that's milligrams) daily.RATING:I rated OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil five stars because it is IFOS five star rated, it has one of the highest omega-3 potencies on the market (85%), it is molecularly distilled, it is soy free, it is GMO free, it is cholesterol free, it is mercury free, and it is enteric coated.

Epub 2013 Mar 23.Three-year low-dose menaquinone-7 supplementation helps decrease bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women.METHODS: Healthy postmenopausal women (n&#8201;=&#8201;244) received for 3 years placebo or MK-7 (180 &igrave;g MK-7/day) capsules.RESULTS: MK-7 intake significantly improved vitamin K status and decreased the age-related decline in BMC and BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but not at the total hip. Bone strength was also favorably affected by MK-7. MK-7 significantly decreased the loss in vertebral height of the lower thoracic region at the mid-site of the vertebrae.CONCLUSIONS: MK-7 supplements may help postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss. Whether these results can be extrapolated to other populations, e.g., children and men, needs further investigation.END UPDATE -UPDATE -MK-7 is a better supplier for MK-4 in vivo than MK-4 itself.Nutrition Journal 2012, 11:93  doi:10.1186/1475-2891-11-93Published: 12 November 2012AbstractBackgroundVitamin K2 contributes to bone and cardiovascular health. Therefore, two vitamin K2 homologues, menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7), have been used as nutrients by the food industry and as nutritional supplements to support bone and cardiovascular health. However, little is known about the bioavailability of nutritional MK-4. To investigate MK-4 and MK-7 bioavailability, nutritional doses were administered to healthy Japanese women.FindingsSingle dose administration of MK-4 (420 mcg) or MK-7 (420 mcg) was given in the morning together with standardized breakfast. MK-7 was well absorbed and reached maximal serum level at 6 h after intake and was detected up to 48 h after intake. MK-4 was not detectable in the serum of all subjects at any time point. Consecutive administration of MK-4 (60 mcg) or MK-7 (60 mcg) for 7 days demonstrated that MK-4 supplementation did not increase serum MK-4 levels. However, consecutive administration of MK-7 increased serum MK-7 levels significantly in all subjects.ConclusionsWe conclude that MK-4 present in food does not contribute to the vitamin K status as measured by serum vitamin K levels. MK-7, however significantly increases serum MK-7 levels and therefore may be of particular importance for extrahepatic tissues.END UPDATE -It is hard to go against the grain when you realize how often people state your review was not helpful simply because it is not what the rest of the people are saying.Anyway, here are the facts. Supplemental MK-4 is synthetic whereas MK-7 is natural. MK-4 (synthetic) dissipates within 8 hours whereas MK-7 remains active in your serum for up to 72 hours (3 days). Yet this product contains 1000 mcg of MK-4 which gives consumers the impression that they are getting 1000 mcg of a vital nutrient for the cost. According to the science (not the bloggers), natural MK-7 is the one you need. So go buy a stand-alone MK-7 supplement. Do not let the thought of missing out on 1000 mcg of synthetic MK-4 sway you. MK-7 is the one you need.Also, the RDA for ALL vitamin K is 90 mcg (women) and 120 mcg (men). Even if this dose is low, three times this amount would not come anywhere near 1000 mcg.I warn against mega-dosing on any supplement. Your body is a system and needs a balance of many nutrients to perform at its peak. We are now learning that those who went excessive on calcium developed cardiovascular disease at a much higher rate (nearly 40%).I strongly encourage you to NOT simply take my word for this. Please Google ""vitamin E mortality rate"". You will find more than 30% increase in premature death rates among those who mega-dose on vitamin E. Not just in the USA but across the industrialized world. This is not just from studies in the USA.So please do not follow the crowd and take excessive amounts of any supplement to include vitamin K. Remember, you get these nutrients in your food as well. I only say this because I want us all to be as healthy as we can reasonably be.The thing I love about science is it is ever evolving. What we view as safe to do today is often found to be hazardous 20 years later but the damage has already been done.Keep in mind the days when everything was ""fortified with iron"". 40 years later they figured out iron was a bad thing in excess.So, let us assume the RDA for K is too low for many people. Whatever the good number may be it definitely is not ten times the RDA. Please consider we are dealing with MICROGRAMS in this case not MILLIGRAMS. When you only require mcg (micrograms) this means it does not take much at all to do the job. I can't stress how tired I am of bloggers and so-called ""Top Contributors"" suggesting that over-dosing on vitamins and minerals is a good practice to follow.Supplement abuse s becoming all to common today. Certain supplements have increased mortality rates (premature death) by more than 30%. Those of us who try to shed light on this are sometimes given not-helpful votes for simply stating facts versus high-fiving over-doses of nutrients.So, due to the excessive doses and the synthetic MK-4 that serves no additional benefit than MK-7 I give this product three stars. I prefer facts over blogs and I never follow the crowd, just the facts. If my warnings have added a single year to someone's life it was worth it.To date, studies indicate that K2 is safe at higher doses. There is a huge difference between ""what is safe"" and ""what your body needs"". Try to use the two-times rule. If you have been convinced that the RDA is too low try not to supplement more than two times that amount. Definitely do not exceed three times the amount in supplementation because you ARE also getting nutrients from your food. With few exceptions (if any) the RDA is rarely ten times below what your body needs for optimum health. Even if it were, a healthy diet will supply a lot of nutrients AND they will absorb at a slower and more even rate. Supplements add to what you are already getting via food. Unlike mega-dosers suggest, you do NOT have to receive 100% of any nutrient from supplements alone. People who consume fewer calories or do not eat meat may need to obtain more of certain nutrients via supplements. Yet, due to their diet, they still do not require pills to obtain 100% of the nutrients their bodies need.If new information is presented, I have no issue with standing corrected. Just be careful people. More is not always better. Balance is the key to optimum health.Life Extension is a very quality brand but even they can get it wrong from time to time. They are human too.!!!! FINAL CONSIDERATION - As long as you maintain a healthy, rounded diet you only need to supplement the difference. Bloggers who endorse mega-dosing speak as though our bodies require 100% of every vitamin and mineral from pills and powders. I could not disagree with this mindset more.Most people who regularly take supplements do so because they are health conscience. Thus, they are more likely to pay closer attention to their diet than others are. Due to their diet, health conscience people should not need to rely solely on supplementation to meet 100% of their nutritional needs. Vitamin excess actually serves to undermine the long-term goals of health conscience people.",3.0,"Great Brand. Unfortunately, MK-4 is synthetic whereas MK-7 is natural.

If you've done all that and still cant maintain an intense 5 hour training session, this is the last thing you can do to help give you a boost. And even at that it wont work for every workout fanatic.It most definitely will not provide assistance to the average person looking to get a little pick-up in the middle of the day, and I really wish their marketing would reflect that.

I have used their grease cleaners, household cleaners, carpet cleaners, and window cleaners and am a Big fan.  The Krud Kutter for Carpets gets rid of stains that a professional carpet cleaner swore were impossible.  The regular Krud Kutter cleaner got the EPA to back off and remove my bathroom from that list with Fukushima, Chernobyl and 3-Mile Island.  So, when I saw they had another cleaner for mold and mildew, I rejoiced and tried it on a really nasty culprit that keeps fighting me for possession of the bathtub.Normally I take straight chlorine bleach, soak paper towels in it, and place them along the discolored bathtub surround. It bleaches the caulking to a sparking white and removes all the lining in my lungs and the skin on my fingers.  I hate doing it, but I hate bathing with black gunk looking up at me too.  And a week later I do it again, because one thing you gotta say about mold and mildew around here, they are persistent.  I've been married to people who didn't hang around as long.Anyway, I gave Krud Kutter Mold and Mildew Stain a try. It works as well as the Chlorine Last Ditch Kill or Be Killed Method, but it's a lot easier to do. And the black gook has not come back as quickly...maybe it's not for gone good, but it's been a while and I'm hoping.  To make sure, I just spray a bit on a sponge when I do my regular cleaning and go over the grouting around the tub.  It just takes a minute, so even a lazy person like me is not overwhelmed.Once I overpowered the tub, I looked around for new worlds to conquer...and there it was: The Stinky Patio Chair Cushion. You could smell the mildew on this from down the block.  I wiped it down with Krud Kutter and let it sit in the sunshine for a day, and did it again, repeating the process three or four times. It got rid of the mildew and the stink.  Okay, maybe I would not bring the cushion inside, but outdoors on the patio, even My Neigbor Who Cleans did not make a face about it when she sat down, and this is a woman who practically has a coronary when she sees my kitchen.

So I told her I would share and buy me some more and if she like it she can buy an amazon card later and I can order her a bottle.

It specified that it also has potassium in it along with calcium.  I previously purchased the 180 ct bottle that only had the potassium.  Also the 180 ct bottle said that it had Double Ground Garcinia Cambogia Extract but the 400 ct bottle didn't.  But it's all made by you and it's the same brand.  Only difference I could see was that it had more count in it and a better price for the quantity.  I just like that it had calcium in it.

At first I thought I ordered it by mistake but then realized soon after that you sent them to me much to my surprise.  You sent me a book and some cards and I absolutely love them.  I was so excited.  And then it dawned on me that the cost of those products were about what I paid for the garcinia cambogia I bought.  How sweet and kind you all are.

Eye,5,5,"My wonderful chiropractor helped me realize that what little meat I did eat was due to digestive difficulties I have had ever since my gallbladder was removed (decades).  Over the years my diet had become high carb white rice or flour-based foods that agreed with my glass intestines.  My chiropractor avoids all grains (follows the Paleo diet) and claimed that my digestive difficulties with meat were probably due to low gastric acid because a diet high in grains keeps it low.  Anyway, I tried Zypan and it has helped me enormously with digestion and especially acid reflux.  I know, it seems counter intuitive to add acid to the stomach to make acid reflux go away, but that is exactly what I experienced.  I did notice that it contains lactose (milk) under ""Other Ingredients"" and sometimes I may get a little temporary and minor gas after taking it but other times I don't so it may be the food I ate.I do not take two pills with each meal, however.  If I eat Thanksgiving I take three, if I have a high fat meal or one with more dairy fat, I take two.  For my regular size meals that have agreed with (me more or less) in the past, I just take one.If you have been taking acid reducing drugs, you will experience a transition period so you may experience reflux until the acid reducing drugs are out of your system and the Zypan can work unimpeded.  I did not notice a difference overnight - I think it took a few weeks for me to notice that I could eat a meal at a restaurant and just sit at the table without digestive distress.

I read them & can't tell if they are safe or not.  It's not as simple as ""paper, soy powder, wax"" or something like that.  It's ingredients that I don't understand & need to look up.  I have yet to look them up, & I hope to find the time to do so.My final thoughts are if you are looking for a safer method for using dryer sheets, then I feel that these are a much safer alternative than the creepy stuff sold in stores.  They smell weird & are overpowering.  I wish people would stop using them.  If you are sensitive to scents these are a dream come true!  If you are looking for scented sheets, they make them as well!  You can always consider the dryer balls.  I wouldn't get the cheap ones.  We did & they fell apart.

It simply saves time and energy in that one doesn't need to worry about hair falling all over the place when they're trimming.  I've been using the same Panasonic trimmer that allows for use in the shower for years, probably close to a decade.  So, when I saw this trimmer was available, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to test it out.  So, already a benefit is that it can be used at the sink or in the shower.  Compared to my old Panasonic trimmer, the blade is excellent, although not as wide as my old Panasonic, and I could immediately tell that there was a difference in terms of results.  I was able to get better results in less time.  Unfortunately, when I took off the comb attachment to get as close a trim as possible, there were a few instances of hairs being pulled rather than trimmed.  No product is perfect, unfortunately, and since I usually follow up with the Andis Outliner, I can readily leave the comb attachment on in the future.  So aside from pulling a few hairs, the only other downside is that it is not as good as the Andis, which gives me the best results compared to close to a dozen trimmers that I've tried in the past few years.  But this one beats them all since, once more, it can be used in the shower, thereby saving time in terms of cleanup.  If you're not looking for the closest possible trim (which really this trimmer isn't advertising and why I have not taken off any stars in my review) but would rather follow the mm size settings that are available on this trimmer, then this Panasonic should definitely fulfill your needs.",5.0,Excellent trimmer,1353542400,"11 22, 2012"
110578,A2JFG0J3E30JP7,B0016RWNQK,Vegan For Life ftp,0,0,"Even though I'm a female I decided to try this deodorant. The first two reasons are: there were limited choices of vegan deodorants available when I found this at one of the websites I generally order from,and this was one of them. The other of these 2 reasons is that the girlie deodorants all implied they smelled like citrus or ""food"", which I always pass on if I'm going to wash with something or put it on my body. I've spritzed dog cologne under my arms,but I refuse to use a mango citrus vanilla pomegranate tea tree oil apple deodorant, lotion, shampoo,soap or hair spray. And anything else I left out.The next reason was,it smells like pine. Who doesn't love the nice,fresh smell of pine trees,right?And the main, main reason is,it is vegan;with no animal testing,and no animal ingredients used in the product,which is more or less covered in the first reason.Unless my bottle was a fluke,you would never pick this if you were doing a blindfold ""pick the pine scent spray"" test. How they get that it is pine puzzles me. What it Does smell like is a sort of incense. A sort of sweet,spicy scent with a hint of something like cedar or calamine lotion.  It's a sort of nice-smelling stuff. It doesn't surround you or reek 2 feet away or anything,but I suppose in a sleeveless shirt or tank top you would notice it was there. It isn't a loud or obnoxious presence though. And if someone really wanted to,they could add a few drops of their favorite essential oil to this,to make it have s scent they(or whoever nuzzles them) finds appealing.This product separates into a clear liquid and a pinkish stuff that settles at the bottom (it has calamine in it),so you always have to shake it. An oil would always blend in when you used it. I got a bottle with a defective sprayer so I had to buy a small (2 ounce) travel spray bottle to put it in. And I only put a small amount (about an inch or two) into the bottle at a time. I found it's actually a better way to do it because at those times when I'm just grabbing my keys and running out the door I can just give a fast squirt or two under each arm and leave. (I rarely need or use deodorant,never use antiperspirant. But in hot weather or those green-inspired ""don't need a shower"" days...a little spritz of something doesn't hurt. Showers aren't ""wasting water"" but I think unneeded showers can fall into the not so green or not so eco-friendly category. (Yes. They use chemicals and fossil fuel and electricity to treat water once it goes down the drain).This deodorant isn't really a gender-specific product but it isn't lily of the valley, either,even though adding a little scent or essential oil could make it more 'yo,dude' or ""pretty-in-pink""... depending on what you put into it. I think guys or girls can use this. (I never wear cologne and will rarely wear an essential oil scent. I suppose what something,like deodorant, smells like, doesn't matter at all to someone who uses a cologne or parfum on a regular basis. And,for people who get migraines triggered by cologne or other scent sprays (whatever it is in scent-wear [especially colognes] that trigger headaches ),this doesn't do that. Or have that in it. I can't wear cologne or be around someone who wears cologne because all it takes is takes ten minutes or less for it to cause a 3 day migraine. Which is why, when I went shopping for scents,I got the Aveda essential oil in their Singular Note line (it's one-source scent,not a scent or oil made of a mixture of scents or essential oils).I don't know if deodorant reviews are really necessary,people generally need one,find it and buy it...but I also think there are enough people like I am,who don't like or don't want to use things that have a certain scent,or who might have whatever odd sensitivity it is,that I have, which translates into getting a headache I'd really choose to avoid,if I could,because of some chemical they must put in certain spray mixtures. And it may be only limited to colognes or perfumes.This deodorant,and other personal care products(also vegan recipes I like or improvised on my own) are covered in my Facebook profile. Which has been deactivated for awhile. I made it a vegan-info profile. At some point in the future,when I can face going through the shared links and shared pictures of abused,tortured,captive and slaughtered animals,I might re-open the info on my Facebook profile. Most vegans,if not all vegans,are vegan for a reason. And the reason is the cruel and inhuman treatment that animals are tortured by, in labs, or killed by, for food,at the hands of a monster. At the hands of man. And lab animals are also killed after the testing and experiments,when the tests or experiments themselves don't kill them. If and when I make some of my Facebook info public(again)I'll put a note on my Interests section here on amazon,where it was before,when my Facebook profile was up and running; open and public. One of the main reasons,or the main reason I closed it down was because seeing that every time I went there was so upsetting and depressing it was having a very bad effect on me. But I still didn't just forget about the animals. I never forget about them. I have pets that have nice lives the billions of animals man kills and tortures every year,will never know or have one second of.... Happiness. Comfort. Contentment. ....they don't get one minute of anything even close to the life they would have if they lived their normal life. They're born into a nightmare. And then weeks or months or years later,they're killed or slaughtered,which is the only end the nightmare has.  Even grocery shopping is upsetting and depressing and can trigger PTSD. I know what is done to fill the meat counters and the milk containers,and the rows and stacks of egg cartons; and the tests for all the make-up and shampoo.  And everything else,that was used to torture and abuse, so cruelly,so inhumanly,the rabbit or mouse or whatever other helpless creature that was abused or poisoned for face cream or bathroom cleaner;or toothpaste or laundry detergent;or, you name it,pick any store shelf. Most likely an animal died or was killed to fill that package.What they do to animals doesn't need to be done. And it needs to be stopped.",5.0,I Got This For 4 Reasons,1384128000,"11 11, 2013"

I tried the Hearos out at a recent orchestra rehearsal and found that they seem to live up to their billing.  The sound reduction really does seem to be pretty evenly spread over the entire frequency range.  The result of this is that instruments retain their natural tone colors and the wearer has an accurate sense of dynamic balance.  The one caveat is that these--like any earplugs--will cause single reed players (clarinet and saxophone) to ""hear"" a higher proportion of their sound through bone conduction.  But, this is not a major problem, particularly after the player either (1) gets used to it, or (2) uses a mouthpiece patch.  The Hearos earplugs also seem like just the ticket for audience members at rock concerts.

211807,A36NB8VS3PFM5C,B003YJAZZ4,Julius Kovatch,4,4,"I have been a Braun shaver user for the past 50 years, starting with the Braun Sixtant model in 1960 when I was still living in Europe. It was an outstanding shaver and I always got a smooth very close shave with it just like with the razor blade. I brought it with me when I moved to the US in 1970 and I was using it for the next 10 years or so. At that time only the foil replacement was recommended by Braun in every 2-3 years, the cutter was claimed to be self sharpening and I never replaced mine. The foils came in flat packs and you just bend them and pop them into the brushed stainless steel foil holder. I brought quite a few of them with me when I came to the US and I never had any problem with it for the next ten years or so.Later on I purchased many of the new models which had a few more extra bells and whistles, some convenience features, twin cutting blocks and became cordless and rechargeable which was probably the most significant change for me. But they really could not improve on the performance of the Sixtant since it was so good to begin with, but I was happy with all the other forthcoming models I purchased.I still have the 7570 model in very good working condition and still holds the charge very well after 11 years, the first one came with the cleaning system (very bad design) which broke after 2-3 months of use, but I felt that the cleaning system on this shaver does not really needed anyway. As long as the cutting block was separate from the foil it was fast, efficient and easy to clean it with the brush. Later I purchased the 8595 model which had a lot better designed jet cleaning system, it was a bit noisier than the 7570 but the performance was the same.Before I got the 790cc I tried the Philips Norelco 1280X w/jet clean system which is a very nice and quiet shaver, does an excellent job and close shave but I could not get used to the ergonomics and the Braun definitely gives me a touch closer shave, my face felt a lot smoother after shaving even with the Braun 7570.Finally I decided to get the 790cc the latest and greatest Braun which certainly has a lot of nice features, bells and whistles, easy to use and convenient to clean it with the cleaning system every other day, when the shaver feels and smells fresh, like new. My 7570 is still in very good working condition and compared to the 790cc it gives me the same close shave as my new 790cc, no noticeable difference to me. However I enjoy the new design, all the new features, the better ergonomics and the convenience of the clean and renew station.So I am back to the same brand I have been using for the past 50 years and I am delighted with the performance of this new 790cc shaver and I can honestly say there is no other shaver on the market which gives you this close shave without any skin irritation, highly recommend it to anybody.Update after almost 3 years:I still have this Braun 790CC which works well but always has been pretty noisy and although I commented before that it gives me a touch closer shave than the Philips 1280XX it is really a toss up since I just repurchased a new Philips 1280XX/42 and alternately using both of them. They equal in closeness of shave and the Philips appears to be made from better material. On the Braun 790CC some of the nice metal looking parts are silver paint covered plastic and this paint coating is now bubbling up at the back under the cutting head after a couple of years of use and Jet cleaning which is very disappointing. The only thing with the Philips that it gives me a touch more skin irritation sometimes if I am not careful enough around the lower neck area, but very close and extremely quiet shave. No doubt that these 2 shavers are the best on the market today and I will be using both of them alternately for a while and make a final judgement if I will keep both of them or just the one I prefer to use.Another update after using both the above shavers alternately for 3 weeks:After 2 weeks of use there was no more skin irritation with the Philips and I had to come to a conclusion that the Philips 1280XX gives me faster, a lot quieter, smoother and even a bit closer shave than the Braun 790CC.

Hermit ""Seeker of the one pure and cl...",0,0,"I purchased this commode on Amazon.com for an elderly relative of mine just about 3 years ago and it has held up extremely well during regular use in the interim.I remember this commode arriving more or less fully assembled. There was really not very much left to do other than to unfold/adjust the supporting steel frame and actuate several push-button locking connectors that this commode uses, attach the seat and then insert the bucket. The height is easily adjustable via its 4 rubber-tipped, telescoping legs.The two arms on the commode are a blessing in helping elderly and other physically impaired persons arise after doing their duty.The now 91-year-old male individual who still regularly uses this commode finds it to be a great convenience and comfort indeed! With significant BPH issues that necessitate frequent urination during the night, it's just so much simpler and less taxing on old joints and bones to be able to relieve oneself directly at the bedside (better - as in more comfortable - than using a urinal).One comfort-enhancing optional accessory that I strongly recommend for use with this commode is the following: Duro-Med Vinyl Toilet Seat Cushion 2 inches (see my review) which is still available here on Amazon.com for about $16.00 to $17.00. It sure beats sitting on the plain/hard plastic seat that comes with the commode, especially if the person in question is going to be sitting for longer periods of time.You also can get a Carex Sitz Bath (plastic insert available here on Amazon.com) for use with this height-adjustable commode to easily take care of other needed sanitary matters. This commode is bound to be the better - as in easier for the elderly to sit down and get up - option for this than the much lower standard toilet seat of fixed height in the bathroom.Depending on the nature of the waste that you will be dealing with on a regular basis, a handle and a cover are also provided for use with the removable bucket.Since I find myself pretty much exclusively dealing with liquid waste, I do not use these two accessories. I simply grab the open bucket with two hands each morning and subsequently empty and clean it in a flash - a very simple task to perform.If you (or someone you know) find yourself for whatever reason needing to use a commode on an ongoing basis, you really can't do much better than purchasing this specific model here on Amazon.com.Needless to say, the relatively modest price being asked (approximately $40.00) makes this item even more attractive.

These are packaged two to a box with only a cardboard collar between them and then Amazon puts the duo into another box for shipping.  Somewhere in the process nobody realized the USPS isn't the gentlest group on earth and forgot to tape up or otherwise secure the caps.  I now know that soap plus cardboard equals not only a mess but it also makes the postal service a little suspicious of what you're receiving (fortunately I lost just 20% or so of one bottle).As for the soap, it does better than I thought.  It's really (and I do mean really) concentrated and these small containers carry over 50 loads in a 40 ounce bottle.  Just a really small cap-full will do the trick and cleaning capabilities seem on par with the rest of the gang.  In my front load washer I could see the abundant soapsuds and dirt was no longer on the clothing I had put in earlier. Since there are no artificial dyes or brighteners you might not get that initial brightness ""pop"" but once I discovered that was mainly hocus-pocus I stopped using those detergents anyway.One thing to watch for, though.  The scent in the bottle is overwhelming if you stick your snout to the opening and take a whiff; however, it is concentrated and the scent on your clothing is not as strong (it's pleasant, actually).  In short, keep your nose away from the bottle opening.Now for the economics.  At roughly $13 per bottle and 53 loads per bottle that comes to about 24.5 cents a load.

Amazon carries several brands of this medication for similar quantities in the same price range, so you should check what's currently available under Amazon Prime and go for the best price. Overall, though, it will be hard to go wrong with Amazon's generics, though, since they tend to be 10-20 times less costly than what local drugstores charge for similar quantities.Benadryl was invented in 1943, and in 1946 the FDA approved its use as the first of the first-generation of antihistamines. Even though almost 70 years has passed, Benadryl is still considered one of the best and more powerful antihistamines. Its range of uses is pretty staggering:1. It can be used for seasonal allergies like hayfever as well as allergic reaction to things like dog and cat dander.2. It can help to alleviate the side-effects from psychotropic medications like antipsychotics.3. It can be used to help with allergic reactions to other medications in general.4. It is an anti-emetic and can help to alleviate nausea.5. It is an anxiolytic (sedative) and can be used as a sleep aid. I have also known psychiatric units to use it in conjunction with other medications to sedate patients who are acting out.6. It has anti-cholinergic properties and can be used to alleviate side-effects of choline-related medications like alpha-GPC and Huperzine-A.7. It can help as a local anesthetic when used topically (although this product would not be appropriate for that).8. If my memory serves me correctly, diphendyamine can even be used to combat things like ringworm, as any parent who's tangled with a school nurse probably knows.Diphenhydramine is not addictive although I have AA friends who feel strongly that its use might lead to a relapse. In truth, just about any medication, including this one, can be abused, so anyone prone to substance abuse should probably exercise some caution.In the United States, appropriate dosing is considered to be 25 mg (one tablet) for allergy symptoms and 50 mg (two tablets) for sedation.

The Yazycraft Dart Balloons do exactly what they should, give you exactly the experience that you'd expect, and are a solid choice if you are searching for dart balloons or even water balloons.  Therefore, on a practical scale, they merit four stars for being a good buying option.  The package contains 166 balloons in red, blue, green, pink, yellow, and orange.  The are tight little balloons, fairly small overall, and not necessarily the easiest to blow-up and tie without a pump of some sort.  But all that is to be expected.We have a local carnival for charity every year with games and contests and I thought it would be fun to do something with the dart balloons for this event.  So we created a booth where popping balloons from afar scored fabulous prizes (ok, not so fabulous).  With 166 balloons, we were able to keep the board stocked throughout the event without the need to replenish.  And we even had some left over, so there was a pretty epic water balloon fight as we cleaned up.  These being smaller, you can actually use them to toss around and they don't instantly break upon the slightest contact.  Overall, these were useful in their purpose.

I didn't know that.  In the morning, your LH is usually lowest, so with almost any ovulation predictor, if you're only using one in the morning, you're likely to miss the surge.  Of course, I learned all that from a article written by an OB that was posted on an infertility website; the generic instructions included with these strips don't give you that kind of helpful information.In fact, by following the included instructions, I spent two cycles *completely* missing my ovulation date - turns out I ovulate earlier in my cycle than the manufacturers of these tests expected any woman to - and it didn't occur to me, until doing further research, that I ought to start checking before their suggested date.  Cycle three was my lucky month; I'm due this winter!  The pregnancy tests worked just fine for me too.  I decided early on that I didn't want to test before the date of my expected period because I didn't want the heartbreak of a ""false"" positive due to a chemical pregnancy.  I wound up testing on the second day of my missed period... which was not completely missed, but not completely there... and got a faint but obvious positive.  I never had any trouble using or reading these tests, once I did my research.Ultimately, I highly recommend these tests.  They're a great price, and the average couple (with no infertility issues) has only a 50% chance of conceiving in 6 months, so the expensive predictors and tests can get pricey fast.  You do need to do your own research on how to test most accurately - these are not super simple, spell-it-out, call-a-hotline-for-help tests - but they're very accurate if used properly.Best of luck to anyone out there trying to conceive!",4.0,"Strips Work Perfectly, But Instructions are Lacking",1311552000,"07 25, 2011"

121577,A3FFRUDJUNP60G,B001CX4JSS,LexNoir,5,6,"I've previously owned nothing but Crest and Oral-B Spin Brush electric tooth brushes which by the way worked wonderfully and I've never had a cavity at 30 years old.  They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you've ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn't work anything like that.This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife's very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you're used to holding an electric toothbrush.There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I'm O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.Negatives:-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.-It doesn't spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I've always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I'm just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit.***** UPDATE 10/5/2012  *******  I've really grown to love this toothbrush.  It's a workhorse.  I spend at least 10 minutes brushing my teeth in the morning.  And at 32 years old, still cavity free.  Because I brush my teeth while in the shower my electric toothbrushes get completely wet.  While they're typically waterproof, I always worry about damaging it anyway.  This thing has been going strong, the toothbrush, the batteries, and it keeps my teeth spotless.  Definitely worth the money, and much better than some of those over priced $200 toothbrushes.",5.0,"If you're used to a SpinBrush, this might take some getting used to.",1307923200,"06 13, 2011"

Some will be repelled by 10% DEET while others will bite through canvas hammocks to get at you. Obviously no repellent will work for every single insect out there, so it's basically a question of trying to improve the odds in your favor. In my experience of being outdoors in the Sierra Nevada mountains, 40% DEET cream is needed to protect exposed skin, while in other parts of the world 80% DEET or stronger is needed - and even then there are insects that just don't seem to care what you are trying to repel them with. They are hungry and you are lunch, and that's it.  The 23.8% spray is great for covering your clothes, because you can't really rub cream onto your pants (well, you can but it's not economical). So if you combine the use of this spray on clothing with a cream at 40% or stronger for your exposed skin, you should do pretty well in most day-hike conditions.",4.0,Best for clothing,1273363200,"05 9, 2010"

However, I was a little put off by the fact that it contains, in addition to the usual binders, sorbitol. Why is this sweetener needed in this tablet? It tastes like nothing and I think its really unnecessary. Next time I am going to try to find another product that comes in a capsule or one without sorbitol. Some people take several grams so even if its a small amount it can add up.To be honest, I dont know for sure if sorbitol is harmful or not. However, I have Crohn's Disease, so id like to keep as many unnecessary ingredients out of my digestive tract as possible. Ive been having gas lately and I dont know if I can attribute it to these pills. Consequently, I always feel a reservation every time I go to take these tablets, especially since I would prefer to take several of them, several times per day.Since dosages are often high, being several grams at a time, it gets a little tedious taking 500mg tablets.

Shaving mugs have a pretty wide range of designs and styles, considering they all are pretty much created for the same purpose.  Any mug that is a little on the wide and deep side can double as a shaving mug when there isn't anything more formal around. And there is no question that they can come in a whole lot cheaper than this one. But a solid well designed mug like the Colonels model here is a fine example of getting a simple idea just about as perfect as it can come.This model 129 is very solidly built, (a lot of them are not, drop them once on the sink and that is all she wrote).  Its just deep enough to handle about any kind or style soap that you happen to have in mind or favor, but not so deep that you end up sticking half your hand inside to get at the lather. It has a good solid comfortable handle that will not slip out of your grip easily, and lastly this mug is a very attractive one at that.  It has a nice modern feel to it as far as convenience, but most definitely has an old style handlebar mustache barbershop look to it overall.  The simple design is handsome without being overdone, and the mug itself is made of a rich looking white bone china.  Although I do not favor the Colonel Conk shaving soap as my personal favorite, it is certainly not a cheap blend.  It has a very masculine fragrance, lathers richly, and comes in at 3 3/4 oz in size, one of the biggest cakes you will find at retail. (For a really super variety of shaving soaps mostly all home made I suggest checking out the wares on Ebay.  They have the biggest variety of fragrances, style, sizes, and prices around anywhere).In conclusion, if you happen to be one of the few vanishing breed of men that still favor a mug and brush, or know a man that is and have in mind this mug as a gift, I strongly recommend this fine Colonel Conk model that comes complete with a cake of their soap.  Personally I much prefer this mug over the other Colonel model available here on Amazon that has a knob on the side as opposed to a handle.  The knob may look cool, but when your hands are wet and soapy its far easier to lose the grip on the knob than it is to let go of this handle.  Believe me, I know from experience!

The Rubber cap that goes over the soap hole doesn't form a good seal and detergent will leak all over the place.  The only way I could stop this was that I had to drive a nail into the side of my cabinets, hang this handle down from the nail, and only fill it up with soap below the dispenser hole (about 1/3 capacity) so that soap couldn't leak out of the plug.  The other big problem is that the seal also acts as a button to dispense soap. By pushing the button, it is supposed to force air into the reservoir and push soap out onto the brush. This works horribly. The sponge version is a little better than the brush, but you have to press the button several times to get any soap out, and you have to either have it filled entirely with soap, so that it is sitting at the top of the hole, or you have to hold the handle straight down and let the soap cover the hole so that when you press the button it forces that soap out.",1.0,Awful handle design,1260230400,"12 8, 2009"

When you were a kid, what helped physically and emotionally heal your scrape better than a band-aid? Other than a kiss from mom and a cookie, nothing.This particular box is the extra-large size and large bandages are great if one has a bleeding-type skind wound near a part of your body that flexes or moves because the sheer fact that there's more material allows for that movement, whereas a smaller strip of material would want to simply give way and detach.Opening each individual band-aid is not as easy as it used to be. I had trouble getting into this package which is something that might be a problem if it's an emergency situation. I ended up cutting it open with scissors and that's not always going to be something that's handy.  The old bandages (and I'm referring to ones from my childhood) all had a tiny string that you could use to tear them open, yet none of the new products do. Probably cheaper to manufacture this way but definitely a hassle for the consumer.This particular bandage's adhesive is extremely sticky, even when they are wet and make a good wound covering for those working in outdoor or wetter conditions than normal. Those with sensitive skin might not like how well these stick and it might be best to soak the area in warm water first to remove them.  The outside ""fabric"" is fairly thick, but it still seems to be able to breathe which will help most skin wounds heal much better than being sealed up tight.Inside of each strip is the actual meat of the product, the gauze pad which is meant to help heal your wound while giving it a sterile covering. In this version, the pad is pretty large and could cover a sizable scrape or wound with no problem, especially a knee or elbow.While I could go on and on how great a band-aid is, personally, I think the cost of these (and any similar product) has really gotten out of hand, almost like these companies know they have a monopoly on bandages. Seriously, 14 dollars for a box of bandages? That's a bit steep.

210374,A2O9ZGE4NN9XP1,B003X5FYJQ,"Haze Blackmon ""NinjaMagicianRollinOnDubs""",3,6,"Let me state it for the record: I'm big on bodybuilding supplements! Especially pre-workout supps... Having said that I wasn't very enthused to try Optimum Nutrition's Amino Energy when it was first released. Getting it free... well, that certainly got me enthused enough to give it a whirl. I usually will take pre-workout supplements on a 8 week on 3 to 4 week off cycle. It just happens that I was coming off a 24 day cycle when I tried Amino Energy. I used it 3 times prior to this review, so I can't comment on the long term effectiveness. Though, like most pre-workout drinks you will build up a tolerance to the caffeine in it over time. Usually takes me about 6 to 8 weeks before I'm no longer getting any effectiveness. The container it comes in small and handy to carry around. It was easy to open... you only have to open one seal where as most supps it's two. I took Amino Energy 30 minutes prior to my work-out.Grape Amino Energy: How does it taste? Pretty darn good! I give it an 8/10 in that area. There are better tasting pre-workout drinks, but you could also do much worse(animal rage, anyone?) What about value? Definitely a bit pricey considering you need to take 3 servings(1 serving is 2 scoops) to any kind of kick from this stuff. In other words, if you work out 4 to 5 days a week this stuff is gonna last you about 2 weeks. Thirty serving per container divided by 3 servings per workout equals a whopping 10 workouts. That's not much for the price! This supp will cost you $20 bucks a pop, not including shipping. Basically, if you want to break it down even further, it'll cost you $2 bucks a serving.How about energy you ask? Well, this is a pre-workout energy drink(it can be used post-workout as well, but personally I wouldn't recommend it for that at all) and you would expect energy... and energy you will get... if you take 3 servings, which is nearly 500 mg of caffeine! Yikes! That's probably a bit excessive. For some reason, for me anyway, taking only 2 servings(4 scoops... I did this on first use of this) did nothing for me, as far as energy is concerned. Next, I tried 5 scoops(2.5 servings) and it gave me a bit of a kick... only 3 servings did the job. The problem is that seems like an excessive amount of caffeine. That's the equivalent of 5 cups of coffee! I don't whether there's using a cheap grade of caffeine or what? Also of note: when I'm choosing a pre-workout supp I like to get good pump and focus of it. This did neither. Why? My guess is because Amino Energy contains no Arginine AKG. It does contain L-Arginine, but there's a big difference between it and Arginine AKG. It does contain Beta Alanine, which is usually vitamin B-3 and is what will give you that flushing, tingly feeling. Those two in combination make a potent pre-workout pump powerhouse. Oddly, I felt none of that flushing prior to taking AE. Maybe there wasn't a big enough dosage of it.Anyway, here's the bottom line: There are much better pre-workout supplements out there in the areas of taste, energy, value, and pump. Amino Energy I would recommend if you are not serious into bodybuilding and need a small pick-me-up. It has lots of good ingredients, it seems. What do I recommend for a pre-workout blast from hell? Jacked(USP Labs), Alpha Fury(Bioquest/Prosource), Animal Rage(if you can tolerate the taste... Universal Nutrition), Hemo-Rage Black Ultra Concentrate(again, if you can tolerate the taste... Nutrex), and Super Pump Maxx(Gaspari Nutrition... if you can tolerate the squirts). Also, Muscle Pharm Assault in the Fruit Punch, Raspberry Lemonade and Green Apple flavors are not a bad choice. The best bang for my buck though, is Alpha Fury(Fruit Punch...can't wait to try Blue Raspberry) and Jacked(Raspberry Lemonade is the bomb). Amino Energy is merely okay. Not great, not bad, just in between. Overall I give it a 6.5 out of 10 or a 3.25 out of 5 stars. The Fruit Punch flavor, in my opinion, tastes better than Grape. I give the Fruit Punch a 9 out of 10 flavor rating. As far as the pump and focus rating... 3 out of 10. It's hardly noticeable. Energy I give it a 8 out of 10 simply because the energy is really good, but you have to intake so much caffeine it's ridiculous! For example with Alpha Fury you only need one scoop and it has 300mg of caffeine... you're very much good to go on that one scoop!Here's what it boils down to: If you're serious about throwing around some heavy weight at the gym Amino Energy probably won't cut it. However, if you need a perk-me-up in the morning or are planning a nice little cardio workout this might be your ticket. If it were me I'd pick something else. I also give warning to taking the full dosage of this stuff. Too much caffeine daily is not a good thing(irritability, sleeplessness, rapid heartbeat etc. etc.) Sorry Optimum Nutrition, but that's just too much caffeine for this cowboy!",3.0,YOU CAN DO MUCH BETTER!!!,1303689600,"04 25, 2011"

And if you're healthy and thinking it won't happen to you . . . think again.  It will.  One day I was fine and the very next day, I couldn't breathe and I still would not have quit if it wasn't for the nicotene patch and the Nicorette.  Don't let anyone tell you it is dangerous to be on both the patch and the gum.  If you are normal with no medical problems, you can do both, but you should wean off the patch.  Nicorette you can take for life.  I probably will get flack here, but I am telling the truth.  The cancer agents in cigs and the tar are what will kill you, not the nicotene.  Good luck to all of you. I am just glad I can still breathe (can't climb stairs well, forget stadium stairs and can't even vacuum the house iwthout getting winded, but you pay for your lifestyle, which I realized too late).

I used to use Gillette Edge because they have (or had?) an unscented version.  Strange as it seems almost all shaving creams have a scent that makes me nauesous.  The unscented Edge was the only shave gel/cream I could  tolerate and it did a pretty good job protecting my face while shaving.  Suddenly I can't find the unscented Edge on my store self anymore, so I start looking around the shelf for an alternative.  This Neutrogena shaving cream caught my eye.  A quick whif and it seemed to have a nice clean scent.  After trying it for a month of Sundays now I can say this stuff is fantastic.  A small amount coats my face evenly with a lubricating layer that completely protects skin and allows shaving in any direction for several passes without reapplication. No silly foam and the results are a nice close shave.  The scent is fresh and best of all my face feels well moisterized and not oily afterward.  Couldn't ask for more really.

28104,A2BD4PA680QAY1,B0006V2RE0,Passau,3,3,"I am a self proclaimed connoisseur of kitchen gloves. And ever so sadly, I am usually disappointed in their performance. In the past, I've bought gloves that are either too tight, too smelly, too easy to rip, bad at gripping dishes or they roll down my arm so that water gets inside the glove and burns my hands. Therefore, I am constantly in search of the perfect kitchen glove. The Casabella gloves have none of the problems that i just mentioned and while these gloves are not perfect, they definitely deserve a five star rating for the reasons below:1) I like that the Casabella gloves are thick. They are not made of thin, flimsy rubber that rips or wears away easily. I have found that some of the thinner types of kitchen gloves tend to wear away at the finger tips when exposed to repeated contact with household cleaners. However, these gloves are thick enough that they don't have that problem, which makes them last a lot longer than the thinner, more cheaply made kitchen gloves.2) I am also pleased that the gloves grip my hands nicely and don't slip down to let water into the gloves. This is one of my biggest pet peeves with some of the thinner, more cheaply made kitchen gloves. There is nothing that I hate more than a splash of boiling hot water running from the sink down my arm and hand because the glove is either too loose or because the glove has slipped down my arm. I am a woman with medium/large sized hands and I find that the large size Casabella gloves fit snuggly but comfortably on me, and do not slip down to allow water into the gloves as I wash dishes.3) I also like these gloves because they grip dishes well. With other brands of gloves I have had problems with dropping soapy dishes in the sink which sometimes shatters them. There is nothing more aggravating than breaking dishes and having to clean up shards of glass from the sink and the drain. The Casabella gloves grip quite well and I though I have used them a lot, I have yet to have any issues with dropping soapy dishes while wearing these gloves.For all of the above reasons, I highly recommend the Casabella Premium Rubber Gloves!",5.0,Crazy in love with this glove,1365033600,"04 4, 2013"

I won't go as far to say that we suffer from an obsessive disorder as to flossing, but I must tell you that we both come pretty close.  We have both been this way since we were wee ones and that was around 70 years ago.  Of all the flosses we have used over the years, this by far is the best.  I have yet to find a product of this sort that is more effective in removing inter proximal plaque.  This stuff not only keeps your teeth healthy, but more importantly, our gums.  As a testimonial to flossing I can tell you that we both still have all of our teeth and neither of us has ever suffered from any sort of gum disease.This floss is quite gentle on the gums yet at the same time extremely effective.  We of course keep a container of this in all of our bathrooms but in addition keep a pack in both cars, in my wife's purse and indeed, in my ""man purse.""Now there are a couple of things to note.  If you find that this product hangs up on your fillings and such, this probably means that you have defective fillings or that some dentist has done a shoddy job.  It is not the flosses fault.  Secondly, this stuff does get a bit slippery when used.  I have found that using a bit of extra floss to wrap twice around the fingers works nicely or if I tie two loops in either end.  This takes little time and puts a stop to the slipping.We personally like the spearmint flavor and the waxed coated variety...it tastes good and feels better.Flossing is probably the most important procedure you can perform during your oral hygiene routine; in many ways it is even more important than brushing.  As long as you do it, you might as well use the best.I must note, as have other reviewers that this stuff can be sort of difficult to find in local stores.  Sometimes they have it on stock, other times they do not. When our stores do have it on their shelves, we tend to buy several containers of the stuff.  This floss is not cheap and the Amazon price here is just about right...could be that it is a bit less expensive that some we have bought locally. I am glad that Amazon carries this stuff as I know now I will not run out due to lack of availability locally.  Johnson & Johnson needs to get off their duff and start doing a better job of getting this stuff on local shelves and keeping it there.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5.0,SIMPLY THE BEST FLOSS AVAILABLE IN MY OPINION,1343260800,"07 26, 2012"

However, I tried another brand of solid ""clinical"" strength scented anti-perspirant and seemed to get the same effect (or lack thereof),odorless sweat.  I may go ahead and keep this on Autoship, just in case it really is helping with the hair thing, and because I hate buying the stuff, but so far I can't say it knocks my socks off!Original Review:  March 19, 2010:  After many years of using Mitchum, and finding myself immune to it, or whatever, I had to switch formulations.  I had tried a ""clinical"" product once before, and maybe it worked, I don't know, but it was very liquidy and the instructions said not to use it immediately after shaving.  It stung.  Well, when you forget to wear your anti-perspirant, you know what happens, and it doesn't smell like roses:)  Anyway,  I tried Mitchum again, and I do recommend it, no stinging, very effective, but it wasn't working for me!  So, I ordered this product because it is a solid (which I usually don't like) and it had good reviews, and I have to admit that the Visibly Smooth part was attractive to me.  Well, I don't care for the Wild Rose scent, but it goes away in minutes.  It is effective, very effective, at stopping sweat, and I find that I do get to enjoy my freshly-shaven pits for longer than usual!Yes, it is expensive, but not much more than you would pay at the store.  Maybe the one reviewer who found it not effective to slow hair growth was an anomaly, or had higher expectations than I.  I thought it would take months to see any result.  It certainly doesn't stop hair growth, that would be scary, but mine seems more like normal now.  Bottom line for me:  It's on my Subscribe and Save Autoship.

My wife has multiple chemical sensitivities and with this product she has had no adverse reactions. I like it too. I prefer water that doesn't taste and detergent that doesn't smell.Of course, if you stick your nose in the bottle it does smell a little but that doesn't transmit to the wash, especially if you do an additional rinse, which I always do... and I probably only use a little more than half of the recommended amount.

Moi?This review might not be totally useless; there are some of us who have a different need for arm protection, and who are really grateful for anything that works. I have always had very thin skin that bruised easily, and as I have grown older it has become more so.  Even a fairly mild brush against some hard surface will leave me with an ugly red bruise that takes two or three weeks to go away; I'm rarely free of at least one such. Thus, I have been looking for something to protect my forearms as I go about my daily tasks--something besides my skin to absorb the pressure.I keep looking for anything at all that will offer protection, and I couldn't resist giving these a try. These arm guards do serve the purpose quite well, with some limitations. They cover only about 1/2 - 2/3 of my forearm, but that is the area most at risk, so that's all right. The problem with wearing them during regular housework is that they feel really icky if they get wet, and so I find myself putting them on and taking them off often, varying with my proximity to the sink. They do dry without harm overnight, but the protection isn't constant. It's not really a relevant issue; they aren't advertised as housework protection. And they are a well-padded arm guard. When I have them on, they absorb scrapes and bumps quite well.It's an off-label use, though, and I have to leave the kettlebell function to those who can evaluate it properly.",4.0,"Not the intended use, but useful",1384128000,"11 11, 2013"

Once all of the kids left home, we found ourselves eating most meals in front of the tv, in the living room. OF course, no matter how care one is, spills happen. I also have pets. So with the combination of habit and house pets, spills and stains happen. I had been relying on the foamy spray bottle type cleaner that comes with a rubber brush attached. That was better than nothing, but it never quite did the job.My first mission with BISSELL SpotClean unit was my recliner. The microfiber material has suffered its share of spills and splatters. Even though I am quick to do clean ups when they happen, there are often shadows of these spills left behind. I wasn't sure that anything would be up to the task of these older stains. Also, I expected using the BISSELL SpotClean, 5207A to be a big project and I have to say that I dreaded hauling it out and getting to it. I shouldn't have worried. The unit wasn't as heavy or awkward as I had feared. The removable tanks make filling the unit for use a snap, and eliminates the need to carry a heavy water filled unit from room to room.I found that the cord was long enough so there was no hassle there, The cleaning attachment tool made it easy to reach most areas of the chairs, and it did a bang up job, even on the old shadows of stains.  I have also used it on a few small spots on the area rugs, and found that the BISSELL SpotClean, 5207A did work as promised on these as well. I have used it with generic grocery store cleaners, and found that it works well with those as well.All in all, I am pleased with BISSELL SpotClean, 5207A. So far it has performed as I had hoped.

277710,A2H0T0PY5IMEFX,B007VB50VA,Alan Dale Daniel,1,2,"I have been using this razor, the QS6140 rechargeable cordless, over the past week or so and have the following remarks.I tried to assemble the razor without reading the instructions to see if the assembly was intuitive.  It was not.  I put the razor onto the cradle incorrectly and I could not figure how to put on the plastic part covering the beard cutter head.  After looking at the instructions it was pretty easy.  More on the instructions later.After charging the razor overnight I started shaving with it and I did not return it to the charging cradle after use.  It has been working fine for over 7 days with no sign of going weak or otherwise making the cuts difficult.  The machine is easy to hold in the hand and it is very easy to maneuver around ones face.  As far as ergonomic use it is the best electric razor I have used, and I have bought and used a lot of razors in my time.  The Norelco with the circular cutting heads is also very ergonomic, but I do not think they cut as close as a foil head.  The good thing about the circular cutting heads is they kind of vacuum the whiskers off your face.  This machine does not do that as it is the more traditional cutting style.  The razor is lightweight and it looks pretty stylish on the bathroom countertop.The adjustments for the beard trimmer, which can also be used for hair around the ears, eyebrows etc, are very easy.  There is a dial just above the heavy duty cutter head and as you turn the dial it moves the plastic cover over the beard cutter up and down.  No problems, you just have to test the cut before you go ahead.  Start long and go shorter.  I made the error of starting where I thought it should be when I cut my eyebrows.  It shaved them down pretty short in nothing flat.  Since one was cut away I had to cut the other one to match it.  At least they grow back fast.  Cutting the hair around my ears and the back of my neck was also a snap.My ""gripes"" are as follows, but they are actually minor.The shaving head holding the foil cutter (the normal electric shaver head) comes off way to easy.  It even comes off when I am pulling the plastic protective cover off in the morning before I start shaving.  The plastic cover over the heavy duty head stays on OK.The instructions are 17 drawings rather than written explanations.  I was able to figure them out, but I did have some trouble with drawing 6 showing how to attach the heavy duty plastic cover - but I finally got it.  I also had trouble finding the light on the razor that shows it is charging.  It is a diamond shaped design on the back.  Since I originally put the razor into the cradle incorrectly I did not see that the charging light failed to come on because it does not look like a light.  Once it came on I saw what was happening, but for awhile I was clueless.It seems the razor is not held very well by the charging cradle.  Look at the illustrations closely because it was not apparent when I had actually put the razor into the cradle incorrectly.  Once in the cradle I have not had it fall out, but it just looks kind of flimsy and wobbly.So far I have really enjoyed this shaver.  I like a blade shave, but there are so many steps to getting a half-way good shave that it puts one off.  Getting the water hot takes time and H2O, then washing the face, then covering the face with hot water, then the shaving cream (I like The King of Shaves by Remington, see my review), then the shave, then another pass with the wash rag, then cleaning off the shaver, then finally toweling off the face. After the water gets hot I fill the basin up about 1/3 so I can swish the razor around in the water to clean it off.  It saves a little bit of water.  I like the way a good clean blade shave feels, but the steps are not convenient.This electric shaver is a cinch.  Whip off the cover and hit the switch and shave.  Since it is battery powered one can use it in the car (not while driving- your life is too important) or watching TV or whatever.  Once done, just take off the foil cover and tap it on the side of the basin or run water over it to clean it.  Put the cover back on and you are ready to go.  Sometimes an electric shaver can irritate the skin and make it feel itchy.  They have products to take care of that, but I think Vaseline lotion takes care of it at little cost.I really like the product and I think it is much more versatile than a normal electric razor.Update June 5, 2012I decided to give the razor a tougher test.  I let my beard grow for three days, did NOT recharge the razor, and then tried to cut my beard.  Often, with a three day growth, electric razors can pull or otherwise give a person a less than ideal shave.  This razor worked flawlessly.  The shave was the same as I had received on every other day.  The razor did not bog down or otherwise show any sign of power weakness.

Then along comes a company that is completely organic and has researched herbs and compounds that have proven to not only deter appetite but also serve as active fat burners and that added little incentive to lose weight suddenly becomes plausible and reasonable.Trusted Nutrients puts their name on their product and in doing so sets a high standard by which other fly by night companies must be judged. This particular product, Garcinia Cambogia Pure Extract 1000 mg with 65% HCA (hydroxycitric acid), Potassium 120 mg, Calcium 80mg is prepared without additives or preservatives and the herb is delivered in vegetarian capsules. It is an appetite suppressant, lowers cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, and provides a process that encourages burning of fat, converting it to glycogen - that is to say, an alternative source of energy release that reduces the demand for calorie intake.Garcinia Cambogia is a subtropical species of Garcinia native to Indonesia. The fruit looks like a small pumpkin and is green to pale yellow in color. It has recently received considerable media attention because of its purported effects on weight loss. It is a natural occurring substance that lives up to its promises. It is important to remember to take as directed and to reinforce its ability to burn fat by drinking copious amounts of water. Personally, the rather startling effect is a very rapid response to burning fat from the belly - some that you will see within a rather short period of use. But another benefit of this product is the noticeable change in bowel habits - regularity becomes the norm without the need for other supplements!

She needed a walker that she could easily get in and out of the car by herself.This walker was a perfect choice.  It is only 11 pounds, so she can easily lift it in and out of her SUV.  The walker unfolds and opens on its own, and she can close it by lifting a single strap.The walker doesn&#8217;t have a basket to hold her purse and shopping bags, so I added some Velcro hooks to hold her stuff.  In hindsight it is probably better that there is no basket, because it would have added unnecessary weight and bulk.  The hooks work just as well and add no weight.

If I am going to take a capsule in place of drinking tea I must really experience a significant benefit. I simply haven't had that benefit. In comparison to lemon balm or valerian root capsules I find the theanine just barely noticeable in its relaxing effect. There is little significant research about the use of theanine as a supplement or as a medication. Also, there are other healthy constituents in tea missed in taking pure theanine capsules. Everyone's neurochemistry is different so I wouldn't be surprised that some people are helped more than others... even prescription medications work differently in different people. In conclusion, those who find their neurochemistry clearly helped by theanine capsules can use them... but not all will find them helpful... next, drinking tea contributes other healthy constituents and is comforting in itself so, I prefer to brew various teas as desired... and, finally, there is not a lot of compelling research for the use of pure theanine as a supplement but some individuals may find it helpful.

It shaves closer. It's hard to compare a used razor with a new one, but even allowing that the blades on the Braun may need replacing, this Remington does a better job around the edges and when your beard is longer.2. It feels good in the hand. My Braun has a straight shape. This Remington is contoured to fit your hand better, and to present the foil cutting surface to your face better.3. Here's the special feature: Most electric razors have a push-out trimmer for side burns and other longer hair. The push-out trimmer on this Remington razor has blades facing in both directions, so it cuts when you slide it either direction on your face. In addition, when pushed out, the trimmer blades are aligned perfectly with the foil shave head.Here's why that is important. If you have an eighth-inch or more beard growth, electric razors usually struggle to cut it well. But with the trimmer blades that face both directions and the way the foil cutter head supports you when you are using the cutter blade, you can slide the whole razor easily across your face, cutting all the long hair in its path.If you look close at the main foil cutting surface on myBraun razor, you can see a tiny set of trimmer blades that face both directions, wedged in between the two foil sheets. These cannot cut long hair the way that the Remington does. I think this Remington razor, and perhaps other Remington models with the same feature, are far superior at cutting longer beard growth.

I have suffered from insomnia on some level for just about since the days I was being told by somebody when to go to bed.  A nightly ritual that includes sleeping pills in some form has been a routine now for years.  I long ago gave up prescription meds as an answer to the problem.  Not because they are expensive or that I am concerned about side effects.  But because I grew tired of keeping doctors rich by having to visit them every six months or so just to tell them that the same insomnia problem I have had for over 40 years is still with me.Although I have tried different brands and formulas of over the counter meds over the years, I have pretty much settled into some store brand version of Unisom now for quite some time.  Long ago I gave up wasting money on name brand meds, so it was just a question of hunting down the same ingredients in a store or generic brand.  At just around $15 for a two pack of the Members Mark, this is the best deal for this formula that I have been able to locate.  At 192 softgels an order, you are getting almost a full 7 month supply in one package if taken every day.  I have not seen any better deal in stores, or here on Amazon.  Also, keep in mind that despite another reviewer here that claims this is not the same Unisom formula, it is indeed the exact same ingredients as compared to the Unisom softgels.  (The tablets for some reason use a different active ingredient).  I have had excellent results with the softgel formula under a variety of labels for years now and this Members Mark brand is no exception.  I have been taking them for about two months and they do as an effective a job of putting me to sleep as any other I have tried.  As far as service, the delivery of this order was fast and with good communication.  I highly recommend the Members Mark twin pack if you are a regular user of either Unisom, or some equivalent of it.  Or if you are just new to needing something to help you get to sleep.

150286,A39NY1WKMR1VTY,B001U0OFCS,Melissa Morgan-Oakes,2,2,"I am not a particularly good or fast swimmer by any means, having just learned this year. I swim 4 days a week now, about a mile a day, since a medical condition precluded running (insert very, very sad face here). I had an older (not Polar) HRM that I had used when running or cycling, but it was nothing that could go in the water. After tremendous research, I settled on the Polar FT4. My husband, a road cyclist, has an FT7, so we were familiar with the brand and the functionality of Polar HRM's.After reading a lot of the reviews here on Amazon and some from other websites, I learned that I should not push the buttons of the FT4 while in the water. Our local Y requires a shower before entering the pool (as most do), so I shower and then carefully dry off one hand and the watch portion of the HRM before heading down to the pool area. I hit the start button just before I get in the water with my dry hand. I do the reverse on the way out - exit the pool, grab a towel, dry off the watch and my hand, and hit stop (or pause depending on what I will be doing next - if I am going for a ride or a walk, I can easily hit start again once I am on my bike or outside).What I love about this HRM:Calorie calculation. I am quite short, so the average calorie calculation chart doesn't always seem accurate. And I am a slow swimmer, which means I probably burn less than the average - or I thought I did. Turns out I don't burn much less, but I am glad to know that for sure.Comfortable chest strap - My old HRM was not comfortable to wear. In order to get an accurate rate it had to be extremely tight. The Polar can be comfortable, not restrictive, and not lose it's signal. I have asthma, and that strap constricting around my chest made me want to scream. I LOVE the Polar's comfortable strap!Comfortable and attractive watch - I have very small wrists and actually emailed Polar prior to purchase to ensure that the strap would fit me - and it does. The watch portion is lightweight, comfortable, and actually is more attractive on than my old waterproof watch. I got the bronze color. It can go from pool to shower to regular life and not look out of place, obtrusive, or ugly.Alert tone for low (out of zone) heart rate - I need motivation. The fact that it beeps at me when I slack off or dawdle too long at the end of a length is motivating.What I do not always love about this HRM:Only one thing bugs me. There is an alarm and ""out of zone"" warning for high HR. I regularly exceed the target rate and that alarm annoys me a bit. I have not figured out how to make it stop alarming if I go over while still alarming when I go under. I have debated ""lying"" to it about my age so that the target zone numbers increase, but that just seems silly. I'd like to be able to selectively shut off the high alarm while keeping the low one.That only this one thing bugs me was a surprise. I expected to be annoyed that I couldn't switch functions when in the water as I can on land for, say, a sprint - I can't just hit a button and swap from clock function to HR function. It doesn't bother me as much as I expected. There are two clocks on the wall and I can see them well enough to watch times for a lap or a quarter mile and so forth. Yes, in a perfect world I could switch and time a lap, etc, but really the HR function means much more to me than timing anything. I am entirely too ""mature"" (or injured!) to care how fast I am anymore. ;)Otherwise, the monitor has performed better than expected. Over all, I love the thing. I waited over a month before writing this review so I could be certain that it worked in the water, as that was my prime concern when purchasing. Observing the rule of not pushing buttons in the water is simple enough to remember if it gets me what I need - a comfortable, accurate HRM that works in the pool AND on land, calculates HR and caloric burn, and keeps date files of same.",5.0,Swimmer's Review,1376697600,"08 17, 2013"

Apparently it's a really important antioxidant in fighting aging, both inside the body and in fighting the obvious signs of aging on your skin.Because I've been feeling a little tired lately, I decided to start taking CoQ10 as a supplement to see if it helps. I began with a different brand and didn't notice much difference. It's very possible the CoQ10 was doing a good job, but I didn't feel anything.I then read that ubiquinol is a better form of CoQ10 for those over 30, because most CoQ10 supplements still need to be activated by the body, and people over 30 can have trouble activating the CoQ10 on their own.Though ubiquinol is more expensive than regular CoQ10, I certainly felt the difference in my energy levels over the past week that I have been taking them, and nothing else in my diet or supplement regimen has changed. I've been a lot more productive, and have been able to get more done despite that usual sleepiness I feel every January.The softgels are pretty much odorless, and I've read that ubiquinol supplements should be taken with a meal that contains some healthy fats.

I was skeptical, so I waited a full two months before I composed this review. Why? Read on...If you have dryness of the mucous membranes, you know how frustrating it is to carry around eye drops. Alternatively, if you take fish oil for the wonderful benefits that it provides for both your heart and moisturizing your eyes, it often has a chance for a funky side effect: fishy burps. Now, my eye doctor once told me a trick to prevent the fishy flatus is to freeze your fish oil pills (which I was doing at the time with another brand). As my doctor promised, the addition of the frozen fish oil pills to my daily medications resulted in no side effects. Of course, you may be wondering, if the icy supplement brand I was using kept away the unpleasantness, why would I accept the supply of Omega 3 Fish Oil?This brings me to the reason it took me two months to post my review.Simply put: Omega 3 High Potency is better. While the brand I used prior to receiving the sample of Omega 3 did help, I still had to carry around bottles of ""natural tears"" eye drops as any efficacy provided by the pill seemed to wear off by noon. Even with the cheapest eye drops that I could find, it gets expensive when you have to buy a new bottle once a week because your fish oil supplement isn't working as well as you hoped that it would. To put it plainly:Omega 3:1) Lasts roughly 12-14 hours, a typical day for me,2) Has nearly eliminated the need to carry around a bottle of eye drops,3) The efficacy is such that I have been able to wear contact lenses, which is very unusual with the severity of my Sjogrn's Syndrome,4) The pill is a bit larger and a lighter amber than those I am used to with the Nature Made brand, which may make it more difficult to swallow (especially if you have dryness of the mouth due to decreased saliva production), and finally, the biggie:5) No fishy gas (which always seems to happen at the worst times!)**From what I know, and I am not a doctor, pharmacist, or a chemist, Omega 3 works better than the more basic fish oil and is worth the extra cost. **An insider tip, given to me by my optometrist: you can eliminate the fish oil burps by freezing your pills -any brand- so you can eliminate that selling point from #5, above. With that in mind, don't dismiss this product as being another run-of-the-mill holistic approach to the nutritional benefits of fish oil and omega acids. It costs more because it does last longer than cheaper brands. That being said, if all that you are looking for is the lack of fishy aftertaste, I have already pointed out one method to avoid that.

309359,A3V79KXIY09MOE,B00BQ5KHJW,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""",0,0,"Have you ever grabbed your cell phone and hurried out the door, only to discover that you forgot to charge it the night before? Or hooked up your iPod to listen to music and realize that the cord was unplugged by your pet and now you have no tunes to groove out to while commuting to work? Well kids, worry no more, as the Anker Astro E4 will supply the juice that your gadget needs, both charging the device AND supplying power to use it during the charge! And let me tell you, that is just swell!Appearance & ConstructionThe Anker Astro E4 is a sleek device that is roughly the size of your hand. It is also a thing of simplicity: four lights and a button on the front, two USB out ports on top, and a micro-USB port on the left side. The case has rounded edges and is very smooth, but not so smooth as to slide out of your grasp. Also inclulded in the package is a small Nylon drawstring bag, a USB charging cord with a female plug receptor on one end, and three different charging heads (iPod/iPad/iPhone, Mini- and Micro-USB) that have male adapters to plug into the female port on the USB cord. The three adapters are, as can be inferred, interchangeable on the plug so that you can use the battery to power/charge a myriad of devices; in my usage I was able to charge my iPod Touch 4th Gen, my Samsung Galaxy SII cell phone, as well as my Logitech wireless headset, all with no issues!In terms of durability, the Anker Astro E4 is definitely constructed to be (slightly) abused. While I would certainly never sling it across a room or casually toss it into a bag, the E4 endured being jostled in my haversack, bumped around on the center console of my car while charging my cell phone, and sat in the back seat of my car for about two hours in direct sunlight (NOT recommended; I accidentally left it out), only to hook it up to my gadget and see that it worked fine.The only complaint that I have in regard to the construction of the E4 is not so much with the battery itself, but the nylon drawstring bag included in the packaging for storage. As I mentioned earlier, the case for the battery is rather smooth and sleek. The nylon bag is of a mesh weave, similar to the type that you see used for football/basketball jerseys. As a consequence the battery is VERY slippery when placed in this bag. It is imperative that if you use this bag to store/transport your battery that you make sure that the drawstring is tight and the spring clip to hold the drawstring is in place. Otherwise your battery WILL slip out of the bag and onto the floor. Also, the bag is only big enough to store the battery itself; the charging cable and three adapters will have to be kept separate. In short, I recommend that you find another case and/or bag to use so that all of your battery items can be transported in one container. This annoyance is big enough that I removed one star from the rating; the lack of ease with which to keep stuff that is rather important for the function of the device is a drawback.UseUsing the Anker Astro E4 External Battery Charger is a cinch: plug the USB end of the included charging cable into one of the USB ports on the top of the battery. Next, choose the adapter head that will fit your gadget and plug it into the female receptor on the other end of the charging cable. Connect the end of the charging cable with the correct adapter into your device, and then press the grey, oval button on the front of the E4: the blue lights directly above the button should light up.A quick note about the lights: there are four blue lights across the front of the battery. These lights indicate how much power that the battery has left to &#34;juice&#34; your gadgets. The instruction book included with the device states that roughly 30% battery power is consumed per complete-charging cycle of a gadget (that is, if your phone is dead, from 0-100% power takes 30% of the charge of the E4 to power your device). As the Anker Astro E4 starts losing its charge, the lights will turn off one-by-one. For this reason, make sure that you keep your battery charged up and ready to use. My personal experience is that the charge will last at least two weeks with no use. And, of course, if you use the E4, don't forget to hook it up (using the micro-USB port on the left side and the charging cable, only using the USB end to hook into a USB port on your computer or USB hub - or into a USB AC adapter, if you buy one).Okay, back to the charging! The E4 is not a &#34;quick charge&#34; external battery device. While it will give your phone/other gadget a full charge, it does so in roughly a half-hour to an hour, depending upon the device (when the lights on the front of the battery turn off, your device is charged). I found that the charging time is a bit quicker than my usual charging through the device's cable, but the battery is definitely not designed to be used if you want a super-fast full charge. In summation: if you realize that you forgot to charge your phone and are headed out the door, you will need to take the battery with you and give it some time in order to acquire a full charge. For this reason the E4 should only be used as a back-up charging device for those times when you truly need it. Using it as a routine method of powering your devices is not significantly fast enough to warrant this becoming a replacement for traditional charging methods.In SummationIt is probably simplest to delineate the Pros/Cons for the Anker Astro E4 External Battery Charger below:Pros:1) The various adapters fit a myriad of devices, ranging from Apple to Android and many things in between, making this truly utilitarian;2) The battery is light-weight and can slide easily into a purse or briefcase for transport;3) Holds its own charge for at least two weeks with no use;4) While it says that each full-charge for a device uses 30% of its own charge, I found that to be significantly overstated: I was able to successfully charge four different &#34;dead&#34; gadgets and it still had two lights on the front, indicating that it could charge at LEAST one more &#34;dead&#34; device easily;5) Is very simple to use: hook up the charging cable to the top, add the appropriate adapter head for your device, plug it in, turn it on, and vo&igrave;la!Cons:1) The included storage pouch is nylon and the battery WILL slide out of it unless the drawstring is cinched tightly;2) The storage pouch is also only large enough to accommodate the battery itself; you will need to find a separate pouch to store the USB charging cable and the adapter heads;3) Doesn't come with a USB Cable AC plug, so the only charging method for the battery itself is through a USB port on your computer/USB hub.While the &#34;Cons&#34; of this product are certainly an annoyance, they are not enough for me to say the product stinks. The &#34;Pros&#34; definitely outweigh the negatives. Thus, if you are seeking an emergency backup for those times that you forgot to hook up your phone or a power outage meant your iPod didn't charge the night before, the Anker Astro E4 External Battery Charger is definitely for you. It is durable, sleek, and moderately priced, and when you combine those facts with the ability of the battery to charge a myriad of devices by interchangeable adapters, this external battery charger becomes a steal!So, if you are gadget-afflicted (like I am), click the &#34;Add to Cart&#34; button now! Having this battery around takes a bit of stress off, knowing that should something happen and my phone/iPod not get charged overnight, I still have a way to charge it without having to disconnect the device's charging cables and dragging them with me while I run errands. I slip the phone and battery into my bag and go about my day!PS - Anker provided me with this battery at no charge to provide honest feedback through reviews.",4.0,Battery Dead? Zap!

My doctor got me started on it as part of a regular regimen for high blood pressure.  This review isn't going to be one to spout the many benefits of fish oil.  Its been known for a long time that fish is good for us, and the fish oil in a concentrared form such as this provides an excellent inclusion of Omega 3 acids into our diets.  Rather, this review is more taylored towards the price benefits of this brand.  It's the very cheapest fish oil I have been able to locate online.  I picked some up recently when I ran out of the more effective, but also more expensive Krill oil that I had been taking recently.  (See my detailed review for Krill oil at the link provided for more info). Kirkland is a store brand from a well known warehouse store.  I routinely use many Kirkland products including, pain reliever, sleep aid, cold medicine, and this fish oil.  In many cases the Kirkland line is the cheapest you will find on Amazon in such personal products.  I have never seen any difference in either the ingredients listed as compared to the higher priced brands, nor any difference in effectiveness either.  In most cases, I end up buying my fish oil and other such supplements locally on a two for one basis.  Two for one sales among a lot of vitamins and such are popular.  I have found under a two for one sale these Kirkland's are still a little more expensive than the store brand, and many cases the name brand when on sale.  But if you happen to live in a place where two for one sales don't seem to pop up all that often, or if you just like shopping online, this Kirkland with 400 capsules at the price they're asking is a real bargain.  And as far as I can tell, the cheapest available fish oil anywhere on here.  Buy two or more bottles and the shipping is free, making it a real deal.

When I first told her that we were going to send her these ingenious shoe laces, she scoffed at me saying something like 'so you think I'm too old to tie my own shoes anymore..."" Her tune changed shortly after receiving these laces, though it did take her a few days (and a bit of nagging on my part) to try them out. Based on her experience, we definitely recommend these laces.Mom's feedback was basically the following: The laces are easy to put in your shoes, and the locking mechanism is not too hard to figure and is also easy to use once ready to go. The length of the laces is customized by cutting them down to size as needed, and she had no problem doing that. They work well in her tennis shoes and marsh boots, and she wondered if a refined version might be released someday that would look good and work well for more dressy footwear.The Amazon sales page states that The Friendly Swede provides a ""Lifetime Warranty"" on this item, which is outstanding. Therefore, if an issue ever arises, we will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.

242512,A1OZA52DFY3SHD,B0052KONSI,Gaz Rendar,49,55,"The BodyMedia Fit CORE would be a weight loss tool that I could recommend, if we lived in a vacuum and there weren't competitive products in the market.I'll begin by reviewing the device itself.  The unit is composed of a small, white plastic measurement center that easily pops in and out of a plastic shell connected to a soft Velcro armband.  The white measurement part has a light that flashes green or orange/red and has a micro-USB port that is hidden when attached to the plastic armband shell.  The back of the measurement center has two oblong metal plates, each with one pea-sized bump and ten tiny, spiky bumps.  Once the white piece is loaded in the armband, it is meant to be fastened to the upper, outside part of your non-dominant arm.  And this is where the fun begins...The CORE device should be wrapped somewhat tightly around your arm, but you should still be able to slide a finger or two between your arm and the band.  Finding the right amount of tightness is key.  Once the metal plates are up against your arm, the CORE will calibrate itself and chirp after a couple minutes, letting you know that the device is now recording your measurements.  If the contact between your arm and the metal plates is too loose, the device will beep and stop recording data.  Too tight, and it'll hurt your arm.  It's an annoying game that you'll constantly play all day long.  I would forget about the device for several hours at a time, but then it might get sweaty or itchy and I would fuss with it.  The biggest downfall of the device is trying to wear it under a long-sleeve shirt.  Since my button-down shirts have moderately tight sleeves, the CORE is constantly being pulled down my arm during the day due to the friction between the sleeve and the armband.  Getting the armband back into position with long sleeves on is also a challenge because it's difficult to re-adjust the Velcro strap.  Finally, wearing the CORE for 22-23 hours a day caused noticeable skin irritation, itchiness, and even very mild pain.  On my third day with the device I developed a 1 centimeter diameter blister on my arm.  I don't know if that was from an allergic reaction to the metal pads, or it was due to sweat build-up underneath the device.  Either way, it wasn't good.  I wiped down and cleaned the metal pads every night, but it didn't help prevent skin redness and constant blemishes.In order to sync data with your computer, and ultimately upload the data to the BodyMedia website, you have to plug the white central CORE unit into a USB port on your computer.  Transfer only takes 1-3 minutes, depending how many days' worth of information needs to be sent.  The activity recordings are all analyzed on the website, where steps, burned calories, and sleep can be broken down into binned hour groupings.  It's not bad, and it does give you an idea of your activity levels and where you can make improvements.  The idea and organization are executed to an extent that you can definitely track and improve your fitness levels with this tool.  However, after a brief free trial period, BodyMedia charges $7 per month to continue to use the website.  Without the website you're left with a pretty expensive paperweight around your arm.  Additionally, a credit card number must be linked to your account before your free trial period can begin.So even though the BodyMedia Fit CORE does what it claims to do, I can't recommend the product in good faith to almost anyone.  Why?  Because this same idea is executed so much better by competitor products, namely the Fitbit.  The Fitbit can be worn on your clothes, so it doesn't aggravate your skin.  The Fitbit is cheaper.  The Fitbit's normal website functions are free and data syncing is wireless.  Plus, the Fitbit has a built in screen so that I can track my calories, steps, and stairs right on the device.  With the BodyMedia I have to buy an accessory wristwatch-screen to see my steps and calories burned, or I have to turn on my computer, get out the USB plug and upload my data just to see how active I've been on a random Tuesday.  With the Fitbit, I can see that I only walked 3,000 steps so I better go get another 2000 before I go to bed.  The BodyMedia takes 15 minutes for me to see that from booting my computer, syncing, and going to the website.The BodyMedia claims that the direct metal-pad contact provides its main advantage; highly accurate readings.  Well, I wore the CORE and the Fitbit together for a week.  Here's the CORE daily calories, steps, sleep time (efficiency) and then the corresponding Fitbit calories, steps, and sleep time (efficiency):2592 / 4644 / 5:11 (90%)  2481 / 5937 / 6:02 (99%)2801 / 6053 / 4:39 (89%)  2508 / 6894 / 4:56 (100%)2688 / 5138 / 0:00  2429 / 5942 / 5:22 (100%)3625 / 5957 / 4:32 (90%)  2446 / 6599 / 4:35 (100%)2527 / 2621 / 7:08 (90%)  2346 / 4286 / 7:38 (98%)2831 / 7163 / 7:31 (92%)  2658 / 7711/ 7:40 (98%)2750 / 6272 / 5:33 (86%)  2671 / 7498 / 5:22 (95%)2710 / 5024 / 5:33 (86%)  2448 / 5346 / 6:16 (99%)2813 / 6591 / 4:34 (79%)  2560 / 7195 / 5:32 (91%)As you can see, the CORE always estimates 100-300 more calories burned than the Fitbit, but the Fitbit records 700-1500 more steps each day.  I've tested the Fitbit can I can vouch that the step counting is 99% accurate.  But I don't have the expensive physiological equipment to test true calorie burn.  I'm guessing the CORE is more accurate for calorie counting, but I have no way of knowing.  Sleep can be inconsistent as well.  The user hits a button to tell the Fitbit when you're about to goto sleep, but one of the CORE's advantages is that it ""knows"" when you fell asleep.  Except it says I got fewer minutes of sleep than the Fitbit (which I know isn't true on certain nights) and on one night the CORE didn't even register any sleep time even though I was in bed for 5.5 hours.So what does it all mean?  Well, I can only recommend the CORE for two types of people.  First, for the person who is eating frozen microwave meals every day and can literally record their EXACT amount of calorie intake, the BodyMedia might to a better job managing the calorie in versus calorie burn ratio on a daily basis.  Second, if you do not do any cardio running activities but you do lift weights on a regular basis, I imagine the BodyMedia will do a better job of tracking true daily calorie burn than the Fitbit.  Other than that, the Fitbit can do everything else in a more convenient fashion and the website's standard features are all free.  Therefore, 2 stars for the BodyMedia Fit CORE - it indeed does what it claims to do, albeit it in an expensive, inconvenient, and literally painful way.",2.0,Great...if you are unable to purchase a comparable product,1334793600,"04 19, 2012"

Gillette pushed pretty hard to upgrade me from 3 blades (Sensor Excel 3 and Mach 3) to 5 blades - from sending me samples, to great offers to making it unavailable in my market. They also recently introduced the Gillette Venus Embrace with 5 blades. After ""convincing"" me that 5 blades are better than 3 and releasing a 5 blade product for women, they want to sell a 3 blade product to me?!! Or is this just a gateway blade?! ;o)The Gillette BODY is plastic/rubber constructed with an anti-slip design - great for the shower. For men using Gillette Fusion or any other metal razor, it feels a little unwieldy and cheap in the hand - like a disposable razor. The BODY works well, but not as good as the Venus. The Venus cuts a little closer. Cleaning hair from the BODY or Venus required regular tapping of the cartridge against the shower wall. Of course, the more infrequently you shave, greater the difficulty in getting the hair removed from either of the cartridges. The lubrication strips on the BODY work well, but unless they are completely worn out, the type of shaving gel/lotion/foam you use makes a bigger difference.Gillette states in its FAQs, ""...If she shaves a larger area, you may find that after only a few shaves, your blade has dulled considerably, increasing the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Tell her to try a razor specifically designed for the way a woman shaves, such as Gillette Venus Embrace."" This seems to imply that the Venus blade (with 5 Blades) might get more mileage for the money. Also, Gillette states on their website, ""Gillette BODY allows you to shave your most important parts with confidence and less feel of irritation (versus Gillette Sensor 2 Plus disposable)"". I believe the Sensor 2 was a blade from the 1990s - why compare to that and not a more recent, relevant product?The Gillette Venus Embrace blades (four-pack) on Amazon costs a dollar more than a four-pack of the Gillette BODY blades.It is great to have a newer generation product for manscaping, but one feels a little taken if the same company has already been producing a better product line for another segment of people.Pros:* New improved, product over previous  generations of manscaping products* Lubrication strip works wellCons:* Plastic/Rubber construction feels cheap in the hand - like a disposable* Not as good as comparable Gillette Venus Embrace for women* Gillette Venus Embrace for women works better - 5 blades versus 3 for the BODY* BODY Cartridges are more expensive than Gillette's Venus Embrace cartridges",2.0,"Men Are From Mars, Women Use Gillette Venus!",1397692800,"04 17, 2014"

3129,ADRYHOAJ0BCKU,B0000532QB,Frequent Amazon Shopper,56,75,"My DH and I are both in our late 30s and I just became pregnant for the first time, with some help from this fertility monitor. After all I'd heard about pregnancy taking a long time especially with older mothers, I was anxious to get a head start after getting married recently.  I had been on birth control pills since my 20s and came off them after our wedding a few months ago. At that time, my husband and I decided to wait a few months before trying to conceive, to clear any medications, vaccinations, and ""cosmeceuticals""(Rx retin-A face cream, Latisse, etc) out of my system. But at that time I started taking prenatal multi, DHA, and calcium.  Then last month we decided to start trying to conceive, with the help of this CBE fertility monitor.This monitor is easy to use.  Just insert 4 AAA batteries (not incl). Turn it on. Press the ""m"" button until you get to the current day of your cycle (you can set it on any of days 1-5). Whatever time of day you set the ""m"" button, that will be the middle of your 6 hour test window. So each day, you can turn on the monitor and test any time during the 3 hours before and the 3 hours after that time. I set mine at 7am so I could test from 4-10am.  If you plan to travel across alot of time zones so that your test window is no longer in the morning, you can still use it within that same window (so in my case, that would be whatever local time is at 4-10am in my home time zone).  Just hold your urine for at least 4 hours before testing, to simulate it being your first morning urine (hormones have more time to build up that way).Then every morning, turn on the monitor before you use the bathroom. For a few days it won't tell you to do anything, and it just tells you what day it is (1, 2, 3, etc) and shows a ""low"" reading, so then you turn it off. On the days when you turn it on and it shows a flashing test stick symbol, you take a test each such day, using your first morning urine. You can hold the test stick in your urine stream or dip it into a cup of urine.  You can collect urine in a cup if you cannot test right away, you can store the urine and test later. Then insert the test stick into the monitor in the direction shown in the instructions, until it clicks. Wait a few minutes and come back and check it.  If you wait too long and the monitor turns off (I would forget about it while eating breakfast), no problem, just turn it back on and the test result will be waiting for you.  It will take about 20 test days in the first cycle to learn your cycle.  After that it should ask you for about 10 or so tests per cycle. It is supposed to give you a few days of ""high"", 2 days of ""peak"" and 1 day of ""high"" readings, in that exact order (H,H,H,P,P,H). Ovulation itself should be on the last peak day or on the last high day.  The monitor may not give peak days in some cycles but it doesn't mean ovulation didn't occur. So in any case you should BD on some of the high days, not just peak.You must buy the packages of 30 test sticks separately, so if you order this monitor, you also need to buy a package of 30 test sticks and also separately get 4 AAA batteries. Store the monitor and test sticks on your dresser in the bedroom, or anyplace outside the bathroom since the humidity of the bathroom can damage it.  It's about the size of a bigger point-n-shoot digital camera or a handheld GPS. I kept it on a small tray (better for my sleepy self to not drop it) and carried it and a test stick into the bathroom each morning when I woke up.I used this monitor with my cycle that first month, starting on the first full day of my cycle as day 1 for the monitor.  It had me testing about 20 times that cycle.  The reading was ""low"" up through day 12 of my cycle.  Day 13-15 were all ""high"" readings, and day 16-17 were both ""peak"" with the egg symbol, and day 18 was ""high"".  After that it went back to ""low"" the remaining days.  This is consistent with the intended results.  DH and I ""Baby Danced"" on days 13, 16 and 17. On the morning of day 18, I had ovulation spotting so I know the fertility monitor was accurate. Here I am now, as shocked as anyone to be a few weeks into my first pregnancy on our first try, as my new husband and I are approaching 40. We are both basically healthy, reasonably active, non-smokers who eat a mix of junk food and healthy food.  So it was not cheap, but to me worth the cost to have more certainty of when to time things, especially since I'm not the kind of person who will do the basal temperature method, and my schedule and business trips to distant countries (and jet lag in each direction) make my cycles too erratic sometimes to predict with much precision with a calendar method. And the cervical mucus method seems too subjective for my preference.In conjunction with using this monitor, I also read the first few chapters of the ""Making Babies"" 3 month program for maximum fertility.  There were some really useful tips in the beginning few chapters that could apply to anyone seeking to become pregnant, and the timing of the whole conception process and when to BD corresponds directly to the CBE fertility monitor.  The rest of that book could be interesting if you were struggling with fertility issues.  I took some of the suggestions about nutrition, lifestyle, etc though and this probably helped too.BTW, in case you're wondering if you can buy a used CBE monitor, the instructions say not to do so because the monitor learns your cycle and becomes tailored to you.  However, the instructions also say that if you let the batteries die or take them out, the monitor will lose all stored info and will have to learn your cycle from scratch again. Take that as you will.Good luck to all!",5.0,"Worked first cycle, late 30s and pregnant for the first time",1328918400,"02 11, 2012"

149939,AHN86VFJIJ2JP,B001TOD684,Chicago Book Addict,5,6,"I often rely on granola and nutrition bars as a quick snack on the go so I was excited to try out this product.  I'm a huge fan of Quinoa and use it frequently in my cooking so I was familiar with its health benefits and taste.  I had also never seen quinoa listed as an ingredient in any of my bars so I was looking forward to tasting something with it as an ingredient.From a taste perspective, these bars were passable.  They were not so flavorful and unique that I would look forward to having one.  But they are flavoful enough that I enjoy eating one.  The strawberries lend a sweet, natural flavor and are well balanced against then nuttiness of the quinoa.  The 'yogurt' layer also adds really good textural contrast and a little creaminess and sweetness.  Overall they are pretty good and texturally remind me a lot of a Luna Bar, although I like the flavors of the latter better.  However, I did appreciate that they were only 170 calories and 3 g of fat which made them more appropriate for a snack or breakfast component than a lot of other nutrition/meal bars.What I did not like about these bars, and the reason I give them only 2 stars, is the ingredient list.  Given that the word nature is in the name and the bars are touted as ""Naturally Simple"" I expected the ingredient list to read as such.  What I got was no fewer than 21 ingredients (not including the ingrediens in components like corn flakes and soy crisps which would have made the count much higher).  I'm willing to give bars some leaway on number of ingredients (my favorite Luna bar has 12 ingredients not including the ingredients in individual components like Luna Pro and Coating).  However, I was more disapointed to find high fructose corn syrup as the second ingredient on the label (and included again as an ingredient in the corn flakes) and hydrogenated vegetable oil in the yogurt coating.  I try to avoid these ingredients and actively choose bars without them.  If this is not an issue for you, then do not let it stand in the way of your purchase.  They do contain good amounts of fiber and protein, 5g and 6 g respectively.  However, the inclusion of these two ingredients for me makes them more comparable to something likeFiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)rather thanLuna Bars, Chocolate Peppermint Stick, 1.69-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)orLarabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Apple Pie, 1.6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16).  I also find the flavors of those bars to be much more appealing and craveable so as a result I do not see myself buying these again.At the very least I wish that they would update their brand website to make it easier for label reading consumers to make an informed decision.  While they do include the nutrition facts on their website the ingredient least is not complete and does not mention the presence of hydrogenated oils in the coating.In summary, these bars are okay.

I would always start a new box of tablets by getting out the strongest pair of scissors I have and spend the next however long trying to remove the tablet without cutting it. It usually required cutting at least three sides of each little one to accomplish this. Then I would put them in a well sealed jar and breath a sigh of relief until next time I ran out.

Your alternatives are:1. Styptic pencil. The troubles are many: white residue on your face, the pencil melts if left wet (so you'd have to dry it), etc.2. Alum. This is a rock which tastes sour and that constricts your blood vessels. The concentration isn't large so you'll run the rock a lot on your face and irritate the skin further. I kind of like this mostly because of tradition - I inherited a few from my grandfather.3. Styptic roll-on's. The problem here is that blood gets on their ball and in the can. Kind of gross.4. Sponge that stops bleeding (usually for more serious wounds). You look like you applied toilet paper pieces to your nicks until the bleeding stops.5. Clubman's dab-on-nik. This is best. It has a sponge that yes, gets blood on, but you can wash it BEFORE the blood gets in the can. Concentration is about right, you may need to reapply, but I guess if you make it too concentrated, it would sting you. The sponge ensures that you apply it on the right spot. There is no residue.

246486,A34UVV757IKPVB,B005ACNP5K,justsomeguy,0,0,"I use shave gels.  I currently use the Schick Hydro Shave Gel and Schick Hydro 5 razor.  The one thing I've never liked about shaving cream or even current gels, is after you put them on and they foam up, if you wait a minute and then gently touch the foam, all the bubbles dissapate and there's nothing left on your skin!  So, I figured this stuff- this non-foaming gel, would be what I've always wanted: A GEL. I was hesitant to try this, because I am picky about my shaving stuff: I get terrible razor burn and ingrown hairs.  But, this stuff worked pretty well!-First off, you notice it has a VERY STRONG SMELL.  It smells like Vicks Vaporub or something.  It actually cleared up my nose while shaving.  A side benefit, perhaps?It does FEEL good on the skin - it tingles - sort of wakes you up / makes you think it's doing something.  It was nice.It's weird to use, because after you put it on, you can't tell or see where you put it.  That was a little odd and I had to make sure that I put it on everywhere, as well as double check places I'd shaved.  You can't see it once it's on your skin, so it makes shaving really weird.  I shave every spot a bunch anyways, and didn't notice any irritation doing so with this product.  I didn't cut myself using it, if that says anything.  I got a real nice shave - I'm happy with that.---So, aside from getting used to that very powerful odor, and not being able to see where it is on your face, I will be buying this again.  It's a GEL that stays a GEL on your face.  You don't need all that white foam clogging up your blade when all you need is a simple gel to cushion your face.  I'm impressed by this product and would recommend it.---** UPDATE **It has been quite some time since I received this and I'm still using it - and liking it a lot.  I've really become accustomed to shaving with a pure ""gel"" instead of those canister gel-things that just turn into foam when you use them on your face.  I do find that this stuff is a bit tougher to rinse off my blade, but overall I like it quite a lot and will be buying this stuff going forward.  The medicated feel it has on your skin is refreshing and nice, and when I want to hit an area again for a second or third (or tenth!) time, you just splash a little water on your face and you can still feel the gel there.",4.0,"Strong smelling, but works quite well.",1320019200,"10 31, 2011"

After trying this Panasonic Sonic Vibrations brush, I have to include it's a good (but pricey) option.Features:-The sonic clean feels amazing and lasts for hours.  The sonic clean is the cleanest I have ever been able to get my teeth from a home toothbrush. This brush is so powerful that my lips are a little numb after using.-The brush is very lightweight (comparable to a manual toothbrush)-Briefly stops and restarts every 30 seconds so you can easily clock your brushing.  Honestly when brushing with this brush, I didn't even notice that feature until I read about it.  But it is there and does work.-Comes with two additional heads standard; a flossing type brush and a rubbery head for a more aggressive clean.  These brushes will probably be used infrequently, but are nice to have for occasional longer brushing sessions.Things to Consider:-It does not hold a charge well.  I get 2-3 uses per charge, so I've ended up leaving the brush constantly charging.-Ladies Toothbrush?  The brush is pink.  I would have preferred a more gender neutral color stock.  The brush head is also really small.  Oral B's heads are small too, so that they can cup the tooth, but they are also round unlike the more standard head Panasonic has.  But due to the color and size, I wouldn't purchase this as a gift for my father.-Base is cheap.  Since the brush is always charging, I did notice the base is lacking.  It wobbles and the brush heads are exposed to the bathroom's elements.Compared to Oral B:Oral B 3000 is still my favorite toothbrush, and the one I will be continuing to purchase going forward.  You simply can't beat the bang for the buck.

And they supposedly absorb better than most capsule formats too.  It squeezes easy and doesn't make a mess.Just straight it's got a bit of a bite.

119353,ALVYD6HBLYI0W,B001BJLGZC,"D. Johnson ""Chi-Town Dale""",0,2,"I was hoping that Remington had developed a razor that bested Norelco's rotary razor.While they have made some good steps, they have a little way to go yet.First the Pluses --The Remington has a much larger clippings capacity. While the Norelco rotaries require cleaning after every shave (and sometimes halfway through a shave if your beard is thick enough or the cutting efficiency drops like a rock) unless you have very short whiskers, the Remington can hold several shavings worth of clippings because the space is so large beneath the razor heads.-Cleaning is easier in that you can clean the razor heads under running water instead of taking the heads apart. This is a very tedious task with the Norelco, since it is difficult to reassemble the parts when you have them all dusted off. With the Remington, you can just pop the head from the body with the release button, remove the head from the body completely since it is held by a small clip and then run the heads under a stream of water. When done, ensure they are dry and then slip the clip back in place and close the head, after brushing out any loose whiskers in the space below the heads of course.- The pop up trimmer is better than the one on the Norelco. It has a more powerful clipping motion so it more easily clips mustaches, sideburns, around beards, etc. A small negative is that it does seem to want to close more easily than the Norelco's, which seems to have a stronger spring to maintain its position. But the Norelco doesn't have half the power that the Remington trimmer has. So once you get used to using the Remington, you will like it much more than the Norelco for trimming.-The remaining time until recharge LCD display is great. It lets you know how many minutes of power are left before you have to recharge the shaver. The maximum running time is one hour and it counts down the remaining minutes in dark grey numerals on a medium grey display just below the power button. It is about 1/2 inch high by 3/4 inch wide so the numerals are easily read even without glasses for those with vision problems.-Powerful cutting. This razor cuts my beard much more quickly than my Norelco does. Where my Norelco takes four or five strokes across my cheeks to get all of the whiskers cut off, this does it in one or two strokes, three at most. The Norelco is severely underpowered, which may be why it is so much quieter than the Remington is.Now for the Negative points:- The charging is via a simple cord that plugs into the bottom of the shaver. My Norelco shaver has a charging stand, so just setting the razor into the stand begins the recharging process. It has two LEDs, a green one telling you it is charging and a red one telling you that it needs to be recharged. But it doesn't give you clue about how much remaining time there is before you need to recharge it. While this isn't a major negative point against the Remington, it is a bit irritating unless you travel a lot, where the charging stand would then be a negative point for the Norelco.- Noisy. This razor sounds like a grinder. When shaving, sometimes it sounds like the razor is grinding its own blades and maybe it is. I haven't removed the blades from the head to find out if it is doing so or not. Because it is new, maybe it is grinding away high spots on the cutting blades but after a number of shaves using it, the sound is getting worse, not better.- The ""Teflon"" coating on the heads hasn't made the razor any less irritating to my skin. With my Norelco, after one or two shaves, the irritation was virtually gone while with the Remington it seems to be getting worse the more times I have used the shaver.- The ""Floating"" heads are not floating enough. The Remington uses a concept where the entire platform the heads are mounted upon floats. So all three heads are still on the same plane, but the plane itself tilts to adjust to the angles of your face. The problem with this is that it works for wide planes like your cheeks and your throat areas. But when you get to your chin and jaw line, the angles are too sharp to allow the floating heads to effectively work.The Norelco, on the other hand uses an individual head floating system where each head tilts independent of the other two. In addition, each head has its own individual platform that also tilts independently of the other two head platforms. This allows for an even greater float angle that if only the heads themselves floated. What this does is make for much better and closer cutting along the jaw line and the chin areas, while still performing fairly well on broad areas like the cheeks and neck (though not as well as the Remington if you have fairly flat cheeks).So while the Norelco doesn't do as good of a job on those areas as the Remington does, it is far superior to the Remington on the chin and jaw areas.The best of both worlds would be to incorporate the two concepts together, with the entire head mount tilting like it does with the Remington and yet having the individual heads and their individual platforms to independently tilt to allow for better and closer coverage of angular areas like the chin and jaw areas.The Remington is closer to achieving this since it has the broad head platform already floating and the heads floating within that broad head platform. All that is needed is for them to make the last step of making the heads sit on individual head platforms set into the broad head platform they already have and they would end up with a better system than Norelco's.-Quality. I couldn't believe it but in the middle of shaving, a drive shaft for one of the floating heads actually fell off! They are plastic drive shafts and they are mounted in thin plastic mounts. I don't know for sure what happened but I assume that when the platform tilted too far in one direction it put enough side force on the shaft to dislodge it from its setting. It may not have been completely aligned after the last time I cleaned it, but because the shafts are so long because of the larger capacity for clippings the shafts mat not have seated correctly in all three heads. It was very easy to put in back into the setting, but if you were doing your shaving over the sink you have to hope the shaft foesn't fall down the drain! Too easy, which is probably why it threw the shaft in the first place. Either the plastic is too soft or too thin to tolerate much side force before dislodging.This has never happened in well over 20 years of using Norelco rotary razors. Norelco uses drive shafts that are about three times as thick as the ones Remington uses and are not easy to remove at all. This bothers me in that we are talking about shafts that are about 1/2 to 5/8 inch long and about 3/8 inch thick on the Norelco and about 1/8 (or perhaps 3/16 or maybe 5/32) inch thick in the Remington, while the Remington shafts are twice as long which allows for more distortion since the whole platform the heads sit on is so flexible. That is the trade off for having a higher capacity to store clippings. So Remington should not have decreased the diameter of the shafts so they are so much thinner than those that Norelco uses. I believe if Remington used shafts as wide as Norelco's, this problem wouldn't occur.",3.0,Better - But Not Quite There Yet,1227657600,"11 26, 2008"

196832,ACMW9PRXTA70B,B003DV3HE4,SB3,0,0,"I've been using the original cotton KT Tape for the past year, and while it works great most of the time, it's those other times that make for some frustration. The new synthetic KT Tape Pro improves upon the shortcomings of the cotton tape noticeably. The most significant improvements are the difference in adhesive strength and the material's elasticity.The Pro doesn't come undone at the edges as often or as easily as the original does, and sticks better in areas with hair. Over the course of a week, I've showered multiple times with a single application of the cotton tape without having to reapply, however I did notice the tape would loose its elasticity, diminishing its compression effect. The Pro version has maintained more of its elasticity under the same circumstances.I was surprised to find the synthetic tape didn't have a partial seam down the middle of each precut strip to form Y-strips like the cotton tape. This means that for some applications, the Pro tape has to be modified with a pair of scissors because the synthetic tape can't be applied according to the directions for the cotton tape (like for shin splints). KT Tape has updated videos for these applications with this in mind.KT Tape seems to have divided the original tape and the Pro tape into two categories: low and high impact activities, respectively. This is an accurate distinction. I've had times where my application for plantar fasciitis would be problem free when walking around, preforming day to day tasks, but as soon as I began a run, the original cotton tape would peel off. The Pro tape has yet to do this. Between the two, the Pro tape is better, even for the price difference, simply because you'll reapply less often, so you're buying less tape in the same amount of time if used on a regular basis.And yes, this stuff really does work.",4.0,"New tape, better than the old tape.",1330560000,"03 1, 2012"

He is, however, comparing it to a very high end razor which he has used for many years.He says that while some of the components are high end (titanium coated blades) other parts are not as sturdy or well thought out.  It does not come with a charging dock, but plugs directly into the wall.  It also did not come with a cleaning brush, a little thing but one which is generally provided  The charging indicator is a single light which indicates that it is charging but not the percentage, or when it is charged.He found the shave to be average, requiring more than one pass.Personally I am a little surprised at this, as his experience is exactly opposite mine.  He likes his Panasonic better (but it is the top of their line) and while satisfied with the Remington, finds it just average.  I was less happy with my Panasonic (women's) razor and was very happy when I could replace it with a Remington, which I'd happily used for years until the rechargable battery gave out.  I can say that the brand is very reliable, having happily used their products for years myself.  My husband, however, was less satisfied with this particular razor.  In terms of the shave, it was adequate, but little things detracted from it overall making it not as easy to use.He said he has to go over his face twice, but that was typical, with the exception of his high end foil razor.  The other issues were noted earlier: the lack of  charging dock, good charging indicator or cleaning brush.  He also said it was very plastic and was unsure of it's water resistance.

205531,AV1F8VNJPLPTL,B003U8ESI4,S. Smerud,39,49,"This trimmer is a definite step up from my older Norelco, which essentially had only the most basic feature of a trimmer:  An adjustable guide.  In the interest of deciding whether it's worth it to spend the additional money, I will compare the two.The QT4070 blade cuts very smoothly and evenly, much better than my old Norelco.  The old Norelco (without vacuum) had clippings all over the sink and counter--the QT4070 vacuum captures around 97%, which leaves the sink and counter pretty clean.  The QT4070 battery keeps its charge well.  The QT4070 digital readout ensures I have it set to the correct length, and lets me know how much battery power remains.There is, however, the need to be more careful in the use of the QT4070 than my old Norelco.  The QT4070 has a gap between the top guard and the side guard, which leaves the cutting surface more exposed.  (I.e., you can stick your chin between the guards, and get closer to the trimmer than the guard setting would otherwise allow.)  On the old Norelco it was impossible to bring the cutting surface too close since the guard covered 100% of the cutting surface.  I was initially concerned, but got the hang of it by the second use.Conclusion:  The QT4070 is of course a luxury, but it does deliver for the additional price.  Any trimmer will do the job.  For the additional cost, the QT4070 will provide a smoother and more even cut, with a much cleaner sink and counter, keeping its charge well, and providing a clear digital readout.",4.0,A definite step up,1280016000,"07 25, 2010"

Two weeks ago I started using the system.The Silk'n system came with a cartridge that is good for about five thousand pulses of light. I did immediately start out on the highest energy level after reading reviews that I read. I am currently using the laser on my face.I was really worried about the process hurting. I have seen reviews that state the pain in similar to a rubber-band snapping, a hard pinch, and even a needle stick. I did not feel any pain. There is a pressure-like feeling that subsided within a few seconds. The site treated felt warm, but not like a burn. I did notice a ""singed hair"" odor, which I have not read that other people experienced.The area treated was slightly pink for about an hour after treatment. I did not experience any adverse effects with this first treatment. I did notice that the hair that has already grown back is thinner and has fallen out. I am so pleased with the results so far. I will continue to update this review as I continue the treatments. This purchase was well worth the money.05/02/14 UPDATE- I having been using this system for about six weeks now.

It is the one superior quality oregano extract that eliminates the need to pursue any other products from any other brands like 'Now' oregano oil which has something clearly wrong with it.Gaia herbs has excellent quality control, and what they say is in the pills is in the pills for certain.  This is a supercritical CO2 extract, meaning that the extract is pure and free from solvent contaminants or additives.How can you verify this product is good.  Take a needle and pierce a pill, and pull it out.  You will have a tiny, near microscopic amount of the liquid on the pin.  Lick it, you will taste an entire forest of rich oregano flavor.  If you wanted you could put a pills worth into a vat of marinara to flavor it. I've done this and it's wonderful.But that's not what I typically use this product for.  It's for emergencies.  Whenever I am sick or getting sick, I take up to 3 pills a day for 3 days.  That's it.  If you take it longer, it could potentially damage your liver and kidneys, according to my mom.  (phd biochemist mom).  So i don't.If you research oregano, specifically the chemical assay of the plant, you find it has several useful compounds that confer antiviral, antifungal and antibiotic properties that rival those of pharmaceutical products.  These are in the order of importance (imo): carvacrol, thymol and eugenol, limonene.  Other plants have these compounds as well, but in various and lesser degrees.  These compounds have been studied by nih and this information is available to you easily on the internet.  This is not some froo hippy folkloric information- if you trust what nih is telling you and you trust your doctor then you should have no problem thinking that oregano can be a powerful medicine, even though it doesnt' make sense to you that an herb you can grow in your backyard at 0 dollars per pill would cost 80 dollars a pill from your doctor; or rather that a 20 dollar bottle of a supplement would save your family from swine flu.Oregano is the most important herb for immune boosting or fighting off stomach flu or even food poisoning.  It's not an adaptogen, per se, so it's not good to take it all the time.  Think of it as an herbal antibiotic / antiviral.And Gaia herb's formula is the absolute best there is.

100901,AEJAGHLC675A7,B0013OUJPS,John Williamson,3,4,"Improving and maintaining general brain health has become a hot topic in recent years, especially for those entering or into what we refer to as the middle-age years. It's the rare late night when one wakes up from falling asleep in front of television to not find yet another infomercial that is not promising some miracle rejuvenation of the mind, along with other parts of our bodies. But do any of these miracle cures actually work?TheJarrow Formulas CDP Choline 250mg, 60 Capsulesis an interesting formulation, as it's one of those which seems to be exempt from the exaggerated claims. Citicoline was initially developed in Japan for treating stroke victims. Cognizin (see the product description) is a branded form of Citicoline, a natural chemical found in every cell of the body, and provides an essential nutrient for cells, particularly brain cells. For clarification, Citicoline is also known as cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-Choline), and it's a natural substance found in all living beings.My particular mental stimulant of choice has long been caffeine. Doing a bit of online research, many online resources had noted that replenishing brain cells with Citicoline offers few negative side effects of stimulants like caffeine, but many of the benefits. How effective is this supplement as a ""brain booster"" if you choose to call it that?&#9670; The Brain Booster Experiment:I decided to give it a try with a very unscientific test: I went off my normal 4 to 5 twelve-ounce cups of caffeinated coffee, a daily habit for years, as I'm one of those who suffers no ill effects from coffee. I did this for a 48-hour period, and the results were interesting: I went into caffeine withdrawal during the first day, feeling irritable and unable to focus as clearly.  I had been reading a book that ended being put aside.  Watched a couple of TV programs, including some movies on cable, yet I ended up falling asleep in the middle of them.  The second day was quite similar to the first, except that I had some mild difficulties editing some photos, which is normally a routine task.Following that two-day experience, I entered phase two and took the recommended dosage of one 250-mg. capsule daily.  This was done first thing in the morning and right after breakfast.  Noticed that my ""brain fog"" seemed to be lifting by late morning, and this continued into the second and third days. Cannot honestly say that I was fully back to my ""caffeinated"" levels, but it was far better than without.Since then, I've returned to my old coffee habit, though not as many cups as before. I'm also taking the recommended CDP-Choline dosage of one capsule per day, and must admit that I do notice a small improvement in general memory functions, especially in terms of recall and responsiveness. As noted before, this was a very unscientific test, but one worth reporting for those considering trying this product, especially as a preventive measure.As a side note, when I was doing my own simple research on this, a couple of sites had suggested that the brain, like other parts of the body, needed to be exercised, which makes good sense. If you challenge your mind with memory games and puzzles, it's good for your overall mental health.  There are a few free smartphone apps out there where you can test your cognitive functions, and I did this personally during my own tests.&#9670; Are there any safety concerns?I did some digging around on the `Net for a few hours, and though I found a good amount of information about the use of CDP Choline with age-related memory problems (especially with those aged 50 to 85) and with stroke recovery, there was nothing that I found that there were any general safety concerns. Some sites indicated that there was insufficient evidence for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Most seemed to agree that this medication might improve learning, memory and information processing (cognitive function) in many people.  I can only suggest that those interested do their own search, as mine was focused on preventive memory retention.On a personal basis, as with all newly introduced medications, I can only strongly suggest that you discuss it with your physician or health care professional first, as your results may vary.&#9670; Summary:TheJarrow Formulas CDP Cholineis an interesting dietary supplement that seems to have a number of applications.  Check some of the reviews here, do some Internet research, and see how it might help you, and if it's applicable to your own personal needs.

The good news is that it does appear to to relive pain that would benefit from a deep massage.  In my case it was the sciatic area on left hip towards the knee. Like with other muscle pain and therapies though it is hard for me to distinguish  whether it was passage of time or the addition of the TENS massage that was primarily responsible for the eventual relief. I am giving the nod to the OMRON for accelerating the healing process. Now some comments on the hardware. The control unit itself is a tiny Altoids can kidney shaped piece of plastic with four buttons. The power button is however partially obstructed when the clip with the pad wires is inserted (hence the comment on this being first generation, did anyone actually try to clip it onto anything before marketing it?). The other buttons are 3 cycle patterns and strength up and down button. At first I thought it  redundant to always start at the lowest strength level, because you can hardly feel anything happening at level 1 of 5 ( or level 2 for that matter). But this is very dependent on which muscle group is being massaged. While the thigh needed a 5 setting, when placed on the shoulders a 5 would jerk my neck and arms quite a bit. So the start at 1 and work it up approach is the fail safe method.  Two of the  three different cycles, arm and leg/foot are very similar and what I use most. They vary the strength and duration of contractions. Contract slow, hold then release, or rapidly flutter short contractions. I do very strongly suggest that that maybe the next model either allow you to select the pattern one by one, or simply allow you to lock the current pattern in when you find one that feels particularly effective. Some of the pattern are quite annoying. Especially the ones that start with a prickly needle sensation at the pad area before progressing into the muscle. At first I thought the pad was not making good skin contact, but it was. Some patterns are just annoying. This brings me to the middle cycle position, the lower back. This is just bizarre, it is mostly (not entirely) though comprised of sensations that feel like a dentists drill that starts out small, then gets bigger while drilling into your body. Even for the lower back I prefer one of the other cycles. I also could not help but notice the similarity of this device to strength training abs building belts, and did try it across my abs. Well it seems to work extremely well. When set at strength 5, the contractions were almost at the level of doing sit ups. After running thru two sessions of 15 min each, the muscles did feel like as if they received a significant workout.Finally the pads themselves  (marked long life, and the literature implies about 150 uses before needing a twenty dollar replacement) seem to be very durable. I have used them about 3 dozen times ant they are still nicely adhesive without needing a wash. Supposedly you can wash them 10 times. I have read about some people also using alcohol sanitizing gel to rejuvenate similar pads, but this is also not recommended in the manual.So 4 stars for a useful pain reducing (and possibly exercise) device which can benefit from better plug ergonomics and lock the current pattern function.",4.0,"Effective, amusing and clearly first generation.",1350086400,"10 13, 2012"

The strong motor and small head just works so much better than most other brand of electric toothbrushes and infinitely more cleaner than using a manual brush. Since the design elements on the budget versions are similar to the pro versions and uses the same toothbrush head, I thought the budget Oral B electric toothbrush was just as good as the more expensive Oral-B Pros.However, when I got an Oral-B 1000 Pro Care Electric Toothbrush, the differences were very noticeable! I felt like I went from a classy compact car to a luxurious full-size premier sedan! The motor on the Oral-B 1000 is much more refined. The body is taller and more slender. It makes for a much better brushing experience.One of my unexpected pleasures of the Oral-B 1000 Pro toothbrush is the built in timers. One goes off once every 20 seconds to remind you to move onto the next section of your teeth. Then the 2-minute warning saying you've completed the recommended minimum time to brush your teeth. Nice! One kept me from working too fast, the other reminded me that it's time to finish up.I really like the small round toothbrush head. It reaches to the back teeth, gets into tight corners, and is able to give a good scrub in every dental nook and cranny. The blue bands fade over time to remind you to replace the toothbrush head after a while. (Con: I'm not fond on how expensive the toothbrush head replacements are - yikes!) Surely, the round brush head give me the best clean. No other toothbrush shape comes close.Overall, I'm loving the Oral-B 1000. It's an excellent toothbrush and a pleasure to use.

259266,A1MJFTAZUCGNYU,B0062IWQVU,Tried it all!,0,0,"(written by the hubby) I received this Fusion proglide styler free as part of a Gillette campaign.  This is an ok little tool! It comes with three combs and a battery, ready to use.  I don't have a face full of hair, but I do use this to tight edge out my mustache and beard when I let them grow out a little.  It's great for trimming sideburns too, because those always seem to puff out before you need a trim for the rest of your head.  It's not a tool to use to cut all of the hair on your head, I think we've covered that.  It's easy to clean too, that's a big plus for me.  The caddy that it comes in is substantial enough to hold everything without tipping over all the time.  You can also use the manual razor, which works fantastic for everyday shaving, I have use Gillette blades for a long time because they last a lot longer than other brands, and twice as long as store brands.  I don't get any cuts or nicks around my nose and mouth, and I like the handle better than the one I had before.  All in all, its a super value for $20!",4.0,as expected,1371686400,"06 20, 2013"
47379,A1HT4X1GUTVDX7,B000FED5E4,W. Costley,2,3,"Pros: half the cost of a Sonicare w/charger, less bulkyCons: None so farFirst of all, I should state that I have owned this product for over a year, and I am still giving it five stars.Here's why: I had a Sonicare Advance for about three years and it worked well during that time, but at the end of those three years I had to keep it in the charger at all times or it would die in the middle of brushing. I was sick of lugging around the bulky charger any time I traveled, so when I saw the AA-battery model at Target for $40 I scooped it up.Now instead of having to rely on an internal battery and a charger, I just keep four rechargeable AAs that I swap out when one pair dies. This isn't something I have to do very often--a pair of AAs lasts about a month (that's with two two-minute brushings a day). I have also not had any water damage, so the brush still works as great as my old Sonicare ever did. I do try not to get water on the brush and dry the entire unit whenever I finish using it. In addition, I take it apart once every two or three months and swab the O-ring with alcohol to keep it clean. This seems to be all of the maintenance needed to keep it in top condition.So, if you want a good Sonicare brush that takes up less space and is easier to travel with, I highly recommend this model. I recommend cleaning it once in a while and trying to keep water out of the insides. I acknowledge this might not help if you get a bad unit (as many reviewers seem to have gotten), but mine has been great and I figure it can't hurt!UPDATE: I have now owned it for a year-and-a-half and it still goes a month on two AA rechargeables. Even though I stopped doing the maintenance described above it's still working like new.",5.0,"Half the cost, but more convenient than a regular Sonicare",1201392000,"01 27, 2008"

She is a bit of a germaphobe, not that that's a bad thing in these days of super-bugs. I knew that she never used the regular fabric hand towels in anyone's bathroom, so I guessed she would be thrilled to find these in mine. She was! I don't use them every day in my home, but I came to realize that any guest coming to my home would probably prefer the option of a one-time-use disposable towel and started placing them in the bathroom whenever I had guests. My FAVORITE use, however, is when my grandchildren come over and have a cold or flu or when they bring all their little friends along. Enough said there. Just be sure they know not to flush these down the toilet. Like paper towels, they are intended to be thrown in the trash. I sincerely believe these towels can help prevent the spread of colds and flus around the house, so I always keep a box on hand in my linen closet.They are about 9 inches square, as strong as a strong paper towel, and yet plenty soft enough to use on your face if you felt the need to. They are actually great for removing makeup or nail polish. For those men who still carry a cloth hankerchief in their pocket, these would be a good disposable alternative that your wife doesn't have to wash (a GOOD thing). The box is designed to sit on your towel bar and feed downward. But if you like to keep a bath towel on your towel bar, you can also just sit it on the counter or on the back of the toilet. Don't worry that you don't like the big ""KLEENEX"" label on the box; this is just the advertisement on the plastic sleeve that you remove when you open the box.

Compared to that, this Remington model is obviously not in the same league, but when you consider the difference in cost that's totally understandable. This is a very basic foil rechargeable electric razor with a vertically flexible head, simple on-off switch, and one LED to show charge. It has a pop-out trimmer and comes with a power cable, AC adapter, and snap-on blade cover. Overall, this razor generally works- I wouldn't say the shave quality is the best, but it does the job. General plus/minuses:Pro:Very lightweight for the sizeSimple operationInexpensiveWorks reasonably wellPivoting head- unusual for the price.Con:Seems to be a bit flimsy in generalNo charging cradle, have to plug inBattery life isn't the best, nor is there a good indicator of how much is leftDoes not appear to be waterproof, so no wet shaving/cleaningThe non-replaceable battery is pretty typical for these shavers, so I don't see it as a big down point. However coupled with the relatively low run time it does mean you have to remember to charge it periodically. For a lot of other budget razors, they at least include a cradle so you can just put it back and let it charge, but this guy needs to be plugged in via the cord every time. It does not look like there's even contacts for a cradle charger, nor does Remington offer one.I do like the wet/dry features of some slightly more expensive foil shavers. It makes it a lot easier to clean the blades- just hold it under running water- and allows you to shave with cream or in the shower. However, leaving this out is likely a result of the very low pricepoint and I totally understand that.Is this good for travel? I'd say you could take it along, but it's definitely not the best option. While the Remington is light, it's not particularly compact and does not include any travel features or case. For travel I use a Braun M90 which is much smaller, has a built-in cover that also locked the shaver off, and runs off AAs in case you can't find an outlet or don't have time to charge it. Even my big Panasonic is better for travel, as it comes with a case and can be locked in the off position.Overall, I'd say this is a good product for the price- just keep in mind that you do get what you pay for. You're not dropping $100+ on this guy, so don't expect it to compare to a high-end foil shaver. If you're on a very tight budget or shave infrequently, it does the job. If you're on a budget but not THAT tight a budget, and if you actually shave on a regular basis, I'd say it might be worth spending a bit more and getting a shaver that at least has a charge cradle and wet operation.",4.0,Decent budget shaver,1403740800,"06 26, 2014"

If it were not horrifically expensive, I might try it for another month, but as it *is*, I'll pass.  I seriously felt nothing.UPDATE: The comments below sound kind of crazy to me. I looked up the product, used it exactly as advised, and as it was recommended by a person with multiple years and deep knowledge of the product. Specifically, I mention that I routinely try non-traditional medicines, although usually they are not mass-produced products sold in expensive plastic bottles (more Chinese medicine and food-based nutrients). I do not see how my statement is ""inaccurate"" or ""misleading"" when it absolutely everything I said was a truthful narration of my experience. If you bothered to read down this far, taking ""vitamin-C after the fact"" actually does help, since Vitamin C is a natural antihistamine and helps with decongestion and healing tissues. Since I have a serious, diagnosed, and trackable immune deficiency, I am very attuned to slight changes in my health and take daily note of a multitude of markers in my body. This did not effect my hypertension (magnesium supplements, high-potassium foods, and B vitamins helped more); this did not effect the oxygenation of my blood (tested by a hospital lab during my trial); I've had carpal tunnel issues from *years* of intensive computer use, and this did nothing to help my joints (yoga does more); OPC-3 did *nothing* for my ADD.  If the product works ""in 5 minutes,"" one might think that after a month of studious application, I would have seen some improvement in SOMETHING.  To me, THE REVIEWER, the following comments sound like hyper-sensitive, defensive justifications for spending hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on a plastic bottle of fizzy powder.  MOST IMPORTANT: just because a company's website claims something ""helps"" does not mean that it's proven to work, and not all things work for all people. So note carefully what this actually does. I don't think it will hurt anyone, but that doesn't mean it's helpful.",1.0,I always give alternative therapies a try.,1306022400,"05 22, 2011"

By far the Gillette Proglide is the best safety razor I have ever used and I have been shaving for over 50 years.But, to get the best shave with this razor or in fact, any razor you should follow these simple techniques:1.  Get a shower mirror, not that expensive, and shave in the shower at the end of your routine, make sure water is running and at a pretty good temperature.  The longer you stay in the shower before shaving the softer your beard will be and easier to shave.2.  Get yourself a bottle of Baby Oil, doesn't have to be Johnson&Johnson;'s any brand will do, even Walmart's brand.  I tried the Baby Oil gel, but it's too messy and gooey.  Just plain old Baby Oil.  Step away from the shower and put a good amount of oil on your face and neck. Rub it in as best as you can to make sure your beard is pretty saturated with the oil, you don't have to over do it, but just make sure you have enough oil on your face that you know it's there.3.  Shaving cream.  So far the best I have found is Aveeno's Therapeutic Shaving Gel. Available everywhere just about. Apply the the shaving gel OVER the oil that you put on your face.4.  That's it! Shave now like you would normally with your Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor.  You will not believe the closeness of your shave, plus your face is being nourished somewhat when using the Baby Oil.  The oil makes the razor glide smoothly over your face and actually lubricates the shaving blades, MAKING THEM LAST A LOT LONGER THAN IF YOU DID NOT USE THE OIL.Summary:  I change the Gillette Fusion Proglide blades once a month, honest.  Once a month! And I shave about 5 to 6 times a week.  Getting 20 to 25 shaves is nothing using this technique.  I probably could go longer than once a month, but can't be too cheap, lol.Hope someone tries this.  The combination of the Baby Oil and using Aveeno's shaving cream makes this all work in my opinion.  It's not that expensive to try if you already are using the Gillete Fusion Proglide razor.",5.0,Tips for An Excellent Shave with the Gillette Proglide Razor,1331251200,"03 9, 2012"

That brings me to Speed Stick Gear, Cool Motion scent.  This is rather cheaply priced deodorant that makes the bold claim of being &#8220;48 hour protection.&#8221;  We'll see...Well, I normally put on my clinical strength deodorant at night after my shower, and then do not reapply until the next night.  Since the Speed Stick deodorant claims to be 48 hour, I decided to follow my normal application routine.  So, after trying it out for several days, I have made a few observations...Firstly, it is not quite as strong as clinical strength deodorant, but it's rather admirable for its price.  It does not last 48 hours though, as it seems that by the time night has hit, it's definitely time to shower and reapply.  It's pretty good at blocking smells but only average at stopping sweat (which is fair because even clinical strength doesn't seem to completely stop sweating for me, and I'm not even a heavy sweater).  Lastly, as for the smell, I rather like it.  I don't quite know how to describe what &#8220;Cool Motion&#8221; smells like, but it's pleasant (I guess if I had to describe it, I'd say it smells a lot like many brands of bar soap I've smelled over the years).So, in conclusion, I'd have to say that this seems like a decent deodorant option if you're on a budget.

66352,A59SQA66PPRXX,B000LF5VMQ,@dave,5,5,"After reading multiple reviews, i figured this was one of the better rated products.  Not ever having used such a product in our 10 year old front loader, i figured i needed to clean mine as it was emitting a foul odor only when the washer was running.  I was able to isolate the smell coming from the washer's drain hose (and not the wall drain) so it was not a plumbing issue as some others had been led to believe.  It was definitely more pronounced following a period of less frequent washer usage. First i made note of my hot water heater setting and then i turned up the water heater to the high setting for about 4 hours. Then I ran a load of only hot water and 1/4 cup of bleach (poured directly into the tub once full) to try and tackle any bacteria.  In the next wash cycle, I wiped some of this product on the door gasket & inside flaps and folds of the rubber like material.  Finally I ran this full bottle with the super hot water per the directions and had the most imaginable solid tub of foam visible through the front loader washer window. After a few minutes, i stopped the washer to allow the product to soak and suds to settle down so i didnt have suds coming out of the soap dispenser opening and all over the floor.  During the final spin high speed cycle, i was able to restart the wash cycle while the drum was near maximum speed.  This started the very hot water flowing into the tub while striking the paddles in the spinning tub which blasted the inside top area of the tub with hot water.  A few more suds and some milky water was noticeable once the tub stopped spinning and had filled up with hot water.Now the hose is odorless and using the recommended teaspoon amounts of HE soap measures per load and not trusting the line on the inside of the cap on the soap bottle. Dont forget to return your water heater back to the normal setting.

117656,A3G7AUUKFJJ4TV,B001AQI5VY,Anonymous,1,3,"As someone with a family history of prostate cancer and as a guy looking to achieve a higher level of orgasm I bought this with high hopes. With Aneros seemingly the authority on prostate simulators, you'd expect the design of their product to be top notch. However, I found this product to be a bit underwhelming. For starters, when looking for anal toys you want it not only to have a mechanism which prevents the toy from becoming lost inside the rectum (The Aneros has the two arms which do this), but you also want the toy to stay in place by itself. While most anal toys employ a sort of hourglass shape to keep it firmly in place, the Aneros lacks this which can cause the toy to have a tendency to fall out. It will stay in while squeezing, however this also causes the tip of the toy to press inward, which isn't always desirable. The toy (according to Aneros) was designed to be hands off and controlled through squeezing and it does accomplish this to its benefit. To solve the problem of the toy coming out, one might think to sit down while using it, which is something that is nice about plugs. Unfortunately both the arms and the general design of the toy prevent this, as sitting down with the toy in creates both pressure and pain internally as well as externally where the arms touch. If you're okay with using it while standing up you may be fine, but sitting down no way. Finally the toy itself is a bit long for my tastes. What I find works for both prostate stimulation and just the enjoyment of these types of toys in general is a sense of feeling full. Never once has increased length done anything but cause uncomfortable pressure in my experience. I'm assuming that the length and shape are the way they are to maximize prostate stimulation, but it didn't work as well for meOn the positive side of things, the packaging of the toy is quite impressive to point where I feel like more of my money is going toward the box it comes in as opposed to the toy itself. With that being said the toy itself is of a solid hard and smooth plastic which is easy to clean. In regards to prostate stimulation, yes it does provide stimulation, however I've had better results with a good 15 dollar plug.",3.0,There are better options out there...,1355097600,"12 10, 2012"

Other omega-3s, like DPA and SDA, are types of fatty acids which are easily converted to EPA in the body. In most fish oils, the amount of these other fatty acids is low, but in highly concentrated oils, it can be a significant amount.

The reports include a 5-star rating for each product containing greater than 60% concentration of EPA and DHA per gram of fish oil, allowing consumers to compare fish oil products based on their safety, purity and quality. Most of the highly rated omega-3 fish oil products are listed. Nordic Naturals Omega-3 is a five star omega-3 fish oil product, which is the highest rating attainable.TRIGLYCERIDE REDUCTION: Nordic Naturals EPA Elite is fairly new. It differs from the other two products in that it contains only EPA and no DHA. It is specially geared towards the reduction of triglycerides levels, similar to the new Vascepa product, made by Amarin.  There are a very few omega-3 manufacturers who have taken a similar approach, including Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Plus EPA Mind Formula, (see,Minami PLUSEPA 60 ct Softgels), and Norwegian Gold EPA 1000 Omega Renew Life,(see,Norwegian Gold EPA 1000 Omega Renew Life 30 Caps). While Nordic Naturals doesn't say it, Nordic Naturals EPA Elite appears to target the Lovaza market because of its huge EPA potency, which is effective at lowering triglycerides.POTENCY: Nordic Naturals EPA Elite has the highest omega-3 potency of those in this comparison (83%); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (64%); and followed by Nordic Naturals Omega-3, which has the lowest omega-3 potency of those in this comparison (35%).PRICE PER PILL: Nordic Naturals EPA Elite is the most expensive per pill of those in this comparison ($.64 per gel cap); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.25 per gel cap); and followed by Nordic Naturals Omega-3, which is the least expensive per pill of those in this comparison ($.16 per gel cap).PRICE PER 1000 MGS OF OMEGA-3: Nordic Naturals EPA Elite is the most expensive per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of those in this comparison ($.77 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nordic Naturals Omega-3 ($.47 per 1000 mgs omega-3); and followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, which is the least expensive per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of those in this comparison ($.39 per 1000 mgs omega-3).PILL SIZE: All of these products are 1000 mg gel caps.

Rest assured that this is a real review from a person who actually is using the Ultreo (you can check out my other reviews to see that I've been posting them for a while).But, the topic at hand is the Ultreo. Is it worth the money? Is it better than the other electric toothbrushes?I think so, but ""better"" is a very subjective term. I've been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for a few years. Started with the 7000 series and recently upgraded to the 9900 Triumph (the one with the wireless monitor). Both do an excellent job, and get your teeth a lot cleaner than a manual toothbrush (at least for me). The only problem is that they can be a bit rough on the gums. Nothing major, but enough to feel some discomfort. I switched to the ultra soft head which helped a lot, but still there's some minor irritation.The Ultreo solves this problem completely. It is as gentle as can be on the gums while still getting your teeth clean. Takes a couple of uses to get the hang of it, but once you get the technique down, the process is easy.There's a lot to like about the Ultreo. Love the design - best way to describe it is that if Apple were to make a toothbrush, this would be it. Nice build quality, feels good in the hand, takes up very little counter space. The designers should take a bow.Other strong positives (in addition to the gentle approach to the gums) is that it really does help whiten your teeth. No, it's not like getting a whitening treatment, but I've noticed a clear difference that I did not get with the Oral B (even when using their polishing head). Battery life is good, and it's easy to clean (and keep clean).Some negatives as well. First is the price - kind of steep. The replacement heads aren't cheap either. Also, the brush head is a bit on the large side, which makes it tough to get into the nooks and crannies as well as a smaller head as found on the Oral B. Getting behind the front teeth is especially challenging - it can be done, but you have to contort a bit, and there's usually some drooling involved. Not something you'd want others to see!I find that the best combo is to use the Ultreo as my ""main"" toothbrush, but every so often use the Oral-B to make sure that all areas are getting clean. The smaller head is a lot more maneuverable for me. Plus, I use a WaterPik once a day as well. Yes, I'm a real stickler when it comes to teeth, but ever since I've started paying more attention to my teeth cleaning routine, I've been spending a whole lot less time and money at the dentist! For me, it's well worth the time and money.Bottom line - any electric toothbrush will usually be a better choice than a manual one. If you can swing the cost, the Ultreo is a fine choice. Despite the few negatives, I'd give it 4.75 stars. It's the best choice if you have sensitive gums. Otherwise, you'll also see good results with an Oral B or a Sonic Care. Best way to find out what works best for you is to try them all out - I know the Ultreo and the Oral-B models have a money back guarantee from the manufacturer, so you're not going to be out of pocket if the one you pick doesn't work well for you.Happy brushing!",5.0,A real review from a real user,1194134400,"11 4, 2007"

261698,A3PLXROA2VNLHA,B006F5BCLA,"Amazon Customer ""indigoheirlooms""",137,147,"What is the difference between a basal and regular digital thermometer? A typical digital thermometer reads with in .2 degree accurate and a basal thermometer reads between .1 degree. So this thermometer can be used for normal family temperature needs, not just for fertility goals.The thermometer is slightly lavender in color (at least mine is) It is thin, plastic with a metal time and covering case. Push the blue button and it turns on. Look at the chart included in the instructions and it tells you to take the temperature in the back of the mouth near your wisdom teeth. If gives rectum instructions also. The thermometer should beep if you are using it right at intervals. Then a rapid 3 beeps when it is ready to read. Record temp. Push button to shut off or it will shut off by itself. Clean with water and soap or 70% rubbing alcohol, let dry then store. Simple enough? for a regular temperature it is perfect.It is simple to use and works basically as the instructions say for regular temperature taking. The thermometer keeps a record of your last temperature just in case you need it or forgot to record your temp for your basal chart. If you have a issue reading your temperature, such as you are interrupted with a phone call you need to shut off the thermometer and restart to get a good reading (per instructions) what the instructions don't say is that the thermometer shuts down slower when the temperature is taken badly so if you press the button just wait. If you press it again it will not turn off. The thermometer will turn off by itself in 35 minutes which seems like an really long time for a timer. So you might want to shut if off manually to save battery.For basal however here is what is not included in the instructions. Your temperature must be taken the same time every day upon waking. At least with in 30 min to get a accurate reading so set your clocks. The thermometer needs to be in the same place. For instance if you take it in the back of your right mouth then it needs to be taken there every morning. If you insert it anally then you need to insert it in the same distance. While the instructions are clear that once you use an thermometer in the rectum you should not use it orally ever again I would like to clearly state it here. The instructions give an range of ""normal temperatures"" and tells the reader that a .5 raise is ovulation temp. Figure out what your normal range is. Mine runs high. I am constantly 98.6 - 98.8 without a fever.The box has the definition of basal temperature and has a clearer explanation of how it works. The instructions are more detailed but also have C as well as F in the chart. It is meant as an easy conversion but is slightly confusing as the nexcare is a Fahrenheit only reading. This is for personal conversion purposes. I'm assuming if you need Celsius for some reason.The box does not come with a basal chart as a few other thermometer do but one can be printed up from an online source(quick Google search) or a regular calendar can be used or an app can be downloaded if your phone is equipped with apps (not nexcare affiliated )What is not included is storage instructions. The company and other companies of digital thermometers say to keep the reading accurate not to store the thermometer in humid areas or high temperature areas or dusty areas. To keep the thermometers clean and dry while stored.The thermometer is simple and easy to use. The instructions could be cleared, have all the information including storage on the paper inside the box but does not.

65959,A8YU4W0HMO5U0,B000KU92UE,Angela Stoutenburgh,30,30,"I have had cold sores since childhood - every school photo is an obnoxious reminder.  Now that I've gotten older and have a better handle on my health I do not get cold sores very often: usually as a result of stress or when my boyfriend grows out his beard. Needless to say with them being irregular I get very upset when one comes in.  I have been using Abreva since it first came out and have had success with it: it always minimized the outbreak and reduced healing time.  However, the cold sores always dry up, scab, and peel and then I end up using polysporin to help heal the scab.In looking to purchase more Abreva I found reviews for this product and was impressed with reviews; I purchased these patches as a replacement.  My experiences thus far prove that they will be an amazing replacement for Abreva.I have now used them twice.  The first round was with a cold sore I had on my bottom lip (stress).  I caught it early, put on the patch and kept a patch on all day for 5 calendar days.  I do not believe that I needed to.  After three days the cold sore was nothing but an indent on my lip.  The sore never broke the surface of my skin, never filled with fluid, and was never bothersome.  This second time (irritation from beard) I have a cold sore on my upper lip.  I put the patch on immediately and so far have again been very pleased with the result - no fluid, no breakouts.  There is redness, however, that I did not see on my bottom lip.These patches do stick, even if the edges kind of curl.  I have eaten coffee, tea, chicken wings, vegetables, salads, etc.  They stay on.  I have worn them through the night.UPDATE: After talking with my boyfriend we confirmed that when my cold sore came in it was already on both my lip and above my lip.

Sometimes I cut his hair for him, other times he cuts most of it then I trim up his neckline and any other areas needing attention. We recently received both the Philips Norelco 5100 model as well as the Philips Norelco 7100 model so we compared and contrasted them.  They are nearly identical in most every way except a few key areas of &#34;upgrade&#34; on the 7100 model.  For such a close price matchup, I recommend the 7100 over the 5100 when available.Both units feature:* 5 year extended warranty* ability to be used continuously while attached to power* Feature cuts from .5mm (no comb) or a range from 1mm to 23 mm (with comb attachment)* are maintenance free - no oiling required* include a hard shelled storage case.  Convenient but could include a plastic insert instead of cardboard for better durability.The 7100 unit features:* TITANIUM Blades (the 5100 has self-sharpening stainless steel blades)* 23 adjustments from 1mm to 23 mm (the 5100 has 13 adjustments within the same range)* The comb adjustment on the 7100 is a dial instead of a slide switch as found on the 5100 model.* Lithium Ion battery allows 2 hours of use on a 1 hour charge (the 5100 requires an 8 hour charge to run 75 minutes).  BOTH units allow the clippers to be used while plugged in* Turbo boost for cutting THICK hairAll in all I am VERY impressed with these trimmers, particularly with the QUALITY of the trimmers at such a great value (I've easily paid at least twice as much for trimmers that were not nearly the quality of these updated Philips Norelco clippers!) I highly recommend the trimmers, and for the value I would buy the 7100 trimmer if the few dollars were not a concern to my budget.  The trimmers easily pay for themselves in just a couple of haircuts and will last for repeated uses. This is a GREAT way to save on the budget, especially for those young guys just starting out, or those older who are facing fixed incomes or anyone who is frugal minded yet still wants to look their best.",5.0,The 5100 and the 7100 are nearly identical except a few key areas - buy the 7100 if a few dollars won't matter.,1393632000,"03 1, 2014"

He has very sensitive skin and finds that the wet shaving he normally does causes all kind of trouble: razor burn, nicks and scratches can easily become nasty spots. Enter the Philips perfect stubble trimmer.This somewhat futuristically-shaped trimmer is long and nicely curved to fit your hand comfortably. It comes with a tiny separate brush and a wall outlet adapter. The unit is fairly light weight with a fairly narrow trimming edge of aprox 1.5 inches. The trimmer takes a couple of hours for the battery to charge after which you can use it for some considerable time.The trimmer has an adjustable height knob on the back that goes from 0.5 mm to about 1cm so it's good for more than just stubble and can be used for longer hair too. The head may seem quite small but it's well suited to trimming the face and areas like the upper lip without discomfort.The trimmer is quiet barely louder than our electric toothbrush which is really nice. It's also water proof which makes it easy to clean.  You can put it under the tap in the sink without any fear of it breaking down. This means that you don't really need the small brush that is provided. A good thing because we have already lost the cleaning brush.  It's really tiny, would have been nice to have had a storage place on the trimmer handle to stow it away. The charger is small and used infrequently. My husband has been using the trimmer several times over the last few weeks.The results are good, he got quite scruffy before because of his reluctance to shave, in case he broke out.

121603,A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,B001CX4JSS,Senor Zoidbergo,13,14,"Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  The Pulsonic is about the same size as a manual toothbrush, which is much smaller than all electronic toothbrushes currently on the market.  This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).Now to the nitty gritty, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  Nothing, except unwanted complexities.  The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren't familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.The Pulsonic comes with one standard brush head and one precision head that has a brush area about the size of a toothpick and stiffer bristles.  The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very ""natural,"" and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter.Overall, the brush does everything a sonic brush should, none of the things I think it shouldn't and it takes up less space and looks great.  The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  If you're looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B.",5.0,The new aesthetically pleasing brush,1220486400,"09 4, 2008"

I just think that the lids don't seal completely and shipping companies don't leave boxes in the correct position, so the bottles get tossed on their sides and upside down, which causes the leaks.  Not sure if there is a way around this without the company creating a new lid/seal or having the bottle shrink wrapped (which would be annoying to remove).Anyhow, the bottles are tiny but are greatly concentrated, so they do last for a long time.  This is very nice for storage and for lifting.  I never use more than the lowest line in the cap, but I always use less than recommended.  I do not have a baby but originally started using another brand (dreft ) when I had a dog that was allergic to many different things.  I wash my sheets, blankets, and towels in baby detergent to help with those allergies.When I first opened the Seventh Generation bottle, I didn't think it had much of a scent.  I figured this was a good thing, becaue a baby detergent shouldn't smell strong.  However, after washing a blanket in it, it smelled SO strong after being washed and dried!!!!  I now use even less of the detergent, so it has worked out well.  It's just a matter of trial and error with the amount needed.  If you do have children, I recommend either trying the detergent on something other than their clothing or use a much smaller quantity than you normally do.

The razor itself is excellent with a solid feel and very simple design.  Changing blades is very easy and there is nothing to adjust.  The razor is made of stainless steel (except for the top that covers the blade, this is chrome plated) and still looks like new after four years of use.  Recently I dropped the razor accidentally and I was unlucky that the chrome top got dented in one corner.  I managed to sand down the dent with fine sandpaper, but it did not look nice and started corroding.  I contacted the manufacturer of the Merkur products in Germany by email (DOVO Solingen, if you Google you will find the website and customer service email address) to ask where I could order a replacement part, but they just send me the part by mail for free!  A week later I received the part and my razor is as good as new again.  Still very happy with the razor and now also with the customer service of DOVO!Notes:1. For blades I have used for the past four years the original Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor Blades.  They were rated high at the time and worked well.  They were also very long lasting for me (at least 20 shaves with a single blade).  As a result I only recently needed to look for new blades.  I ordered Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades based on reviews and the fact that I could order a relatively small quantity (30 blades for about $8 including shipping).  The Astra's are very good: they pull much less and allow me to shave much closer than the Merkur.  No nicks or cuts at all.  I do not know yet about the durability (only shaved three times with them so far), but the comfort and closeness of the shave are superior to the Merkur blades.2. For shaving soap I used Proraso first.  This lasted very long for me (more than 2 years).  After that I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream, which was nice, but lasted only about a year.  I am going back to Proraso now.3. My brush is a Omega 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I have used since 2009.  No problems and works well to create a nice lather.

230437,AOEAD7DPLZE53,B004NSUMTO,NLee the Engineer,77,81,"TheAmazonBasics NiMH Chargeris such a perplexing product. On one hand it claims to have ""Two individually monitored charging channels"", which implies it is a 'Smart' charger (one that knows when to stop charging once the batteries are full). On the other hand it also claims ""Timer control for charging cut off"", which suggests it is a 'Dumb' charger (one that blindly charges for a fixed number of hours regardless of battery status). So which way is it? Here is what I did to find out:First, I used it to recharge two pairs ofAmazonBasics AA NiMH Precharged Rechargeable Batteriesat the same time. The left pair was partialy discharged (using theMaha MH-C9000 charger) to around 70% of its full capacity, or 1400mAh out of 2000mAh. The right pair was discharged further to around 30% capacity, or 600mAh out of 2000mAh.According to the product description for this AmazonBasics charger, its charging current is 250mA. So if this is a Smart charger, I would expect the left pair to take 3-4 hours to finish, while the right pair should finish in 7-8 hours. That is not what happened. All batteries were charged for a full 12 hours, and then both sides finished charging together. That seems to prove that this is a timer-based Dumb charger. But wait, that's not the whole story...I monitored the charging current during the charging process. It turns out the charging current is NOT a fixed 250mA, but a pulsed DC current with variable duty cycle. In the beginning stage where battery voltage is low, the charging current is flowing all the time, which gives an average charging current of 250mA. But later on as the battery voltage increases, the charging current is chopped into narrower pulses, which gives a lower average current. Towards the end of charging period, the average current dropped to just 50-100mA based on my estimation.What this means is that: The AmazonBasics charger does have some intelligent control circuit inside. It monitors the batteries' voltage and adjusts the charging current accordingly. A timer-based dumb charger at 250mA over 12 hours would put out 3000mAh of charge, whereas this AmazonBasics charge will reduce the amount of charge based on battery status. So although both chargers run for the same 12 hours period, the Amazon charger does not over-charge its batteries as badly compared to timer-based dumb charger.But does it matter to you the user? You put some batteries in this Amazon charger, and the LED indicators stay on for the next 12 hours regardless of the battery status. So even though your batteries may already be fully charged after 6-8 hours, you have no way to know that and still have to wait for the full 12 hours.I really can't understand why Amazon picked this design decision. It makes the charger look just like another timer-based Dumb charger, even though internally it is smarter than that. By the way, I opened the case and found two thermistors mounted under the battery compartment (see the pictures I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section). That means there must be a thermal protection feature, yet this is not mentioned in Amazon product description nor in the user manual. It almost seems like Amazon is trying hard NOT to market this product as a Smart charger.Conclusion:The AmazonBasics charger is smarter than the typical timer-based dumb charger. But forcing the user to wait 12 hours is just unacceptable. Assuming the price is right (sometimes you can get the whole package for the same price as 4 AmazonBasics AA rechargeable batteries) this is still a reasonable deal. Otherwise, I recommend getting theSony Cycle Energy BCG34HLDcharger. The Sony charger is able to handle individual cells (instead of only charge in pairs) and has a higher charging current of 360mA. So it takes just 6 hours to recharge a 2000mAh battery from empty, shorter if the cell was partially discharged.",3.0,"For a 'Smart' charger, it does a great job playing DUMB!",1367452800,"05 2, 2013"

No tossing or turning that much either.The only problem I had with this mask is that when I first got it I had it too tight around my eyes on two occasions.

Wiping the eyelids, either with a washcloth and baby shampoo or a prepackaged wipe, helps soothe eyes by breaking up the crud that clogs the pores in our eyelids and dries them out.  The key is to avoid getting any harsh soap in the eyes, while still washing them well.  The Occusoft wipes are prepacked and unfold like moist towelettes, while Visine pads are stacked and thick like acne pads.  This is both good and bad.  The thick pads are a bit rougher, which helps wipe the eyelids, but also leaves my eyelids (not eyes) feeling a bit raw.  The thin Occusoft pads are and perhaps less effective, but more pleasant to use.  Both types include enough surface area to wipe both eyelids with no cross-contamination.  The Visine pads are also drier, which may be seen as a plus.  I use them with my face already wet, so they are perfect.I think Visine has a good product, with room for improvement.  I do not use makeup, so judging only on the ability to wipe the eyelids, I would say to try both these and the Occusoft pads before buying a large quantity of either.

277678,A2DRYHBYLO5S8T,B007VB50LU,E. Moscato,6,8,"I have owned all of the prior generations of the Bodygroom.  When it first came out it was somewhat of a revolutionary product as it addressed a major grooming need for males that was not previously fully addressed by other manufacturers.  It offered a product that could shave things other than one's face without the risk of accidents and discomfort.  This version / generation is not exactly revolutionary as it is basically just a prior generation with a back attachment to compete with the Mangroomer.  It does and will perform the function of shaving one's back very well.  However, in that regard, I feel the back attachment could have been a little longer for men who are taller (or wider).Other than the back attachment all that differentiates this from prior generations is the battery charges more quickly and lasts longer.All of the Bodygroom generations have a nice weight and balance and are easy to use.  They are versatile workhorses that can clean up chest hair, underarm hair, pubic hair, etc., and now this generation can tackle back hair.  In each case we have a product that can handle shaving in hard-to-reach or sensitive skin areas and that is why I encourage all to own a Bodygroom product.Then, the question is should you own this product or a prior generation / version of a Bodygroomer?  If you need a product to control back hair then this is your best option.  If you don't have back hair then I recommend a different generation / version.  This particular product has a bulky charging stand that is not necessary.  One is not likely going to want to display a manscaping product on their counter top anyway.  If they did, this one has an annoying power connection in the back that will force it to protrude too far from the wall.  I would have much preferred a simple charging cable instead of the stand.  Plus, if you are going to include a stand at least provide compartments to store all of the attachment combs.One thing to keep in mind as well is all of these Bodygroom products are all great at cutting hair that is overly long.  However, they are not great at maintenance when one is only dealing with stubble that is much tougher and coarser hair.

Especially over the harsh winters here in New England when the air is cold and very dry.  I'm the type of guy that never leaves home without a chap stick or other brand of balm in my pocket.  And no matter what kind I am using it seems I am constantly reapplying it as the day goes on. When this Vaseline brand became available I will admit I was a little wary of it.  I have used regular Vaseline in the past on my lips in a pinch and never liked it.  It worked ok but tasted terrible and was too slimy.  This tiny little tub of ointment may look like regular Vaseline, but that's where the comparison ends.  Its texture feels a little slick on your finger when first applying it, but it quickly moistens your lips and then dries nicely leaving no real slimy or sticky residue behind at all.  The scent and taste of this stuff with the cocoa butter is very weak in my opinion and not at all offensive.  As a matter fact what scent and taste I can detect is rather pleasant.Regardless of what one may think of this stuffs texture and taste, in my opinion there is no question in its performance.  I have put this stuff on and not gone back for more, or reached for my regular stick for hours.  Close to all day actually.  I have tried other tub style ointments in the past and found them not to be of any real benefit over the more handy sticks.  But this stuff is definitely an exception as far as I am concerned.  You may not like carrying around a little container over a stick.  But for me personally this seems to work so well that there is little reason to take it along anywhere at all, if you're planning on returning at end of day anyway.  I just apply it liberally and am done with it for hours.  About the only down side to this ointment is the cost, which is a little more than what you can get other brands of lip balm for.

The Target brand did a good job, but I wanted to see if the name-brand would make my teeth whiter.  Here are my thoughts.1. Honestly, I can't tell if these made my teeth any whiter.  To be fair, the two weeks with the Target brand doing a good job made the comparison of &#34;before Crest&#34; and &#34;after Crest&#34; harder to evaluate.  I do, however, think that the Crest strips were *working*.2. The Crest strips were thicker and easier to put into my mouth.  This gave them more rigidity so that wrapping them around my teeth was easier.  Especially the Target bottom strip was so flexible that it sometimes got folded over and didn't give a good fit.  If it *did* go in straight, the fit was fine.3. The Target brand strips were much thinner and easier to remove.  I thought the Target strips stayed in place very well, but if you are concerned about the strips sliding, get the Crest ones.  They stick so well that they take a little work to remove them.  Not a problem, they just stick more completely.4. The Target top strip was a little smaller and the bottom strip was a littler larger.  I found that I liked the size of the Crest top strip and the Target bottom strip better.5. I found the Target strips hard to get out of the package.  The Crest strips came out of the package very easily.  In all fairness, my wife used the Target strips from a second box and did not have this problem.I know that this is more than just a review of the Crest White Strips, but I was looking for this kind of review when I bought my first set.  I wanted to know if it was worth the extra cost for the brand name.In my opinion, it *could* be worth the extra cost due to the ease if inserting and the firm grip, but the smaller bottom strip that Crest provides concerns me a little.  I thought the size was borderline.The recommendation is to use these strips occasionally to keep the whiteness &#34;touched up&#34;.  I would say that if the Crest strips are not too much more expensive, I will probably buy them.  I got a very good price from Amazon for the Crest Strips so cost wouldn't be much of an issue.",4.0,Comparison with Target Up & Up Strips,1384905600,"11 20, 2013"

7650,A3U94F77I2BEWT,B00009OL68,"Dee Fields ""Deelirious""",11,11,"I had to replace our previous Waterpik, same model seen here - the WP-65, because I finally figured out that there is mold inside the unit that was so bad, it was backing up the water flow inside the unit that only a trickle of water was coming out of the handle. We had followed Waterpik's direction that if you use a mouthwash, you must always run water through the unit one more time to flush out any lingering mouthwash (indeed, they can dry to a sticky film). We did this religiously. We had the previous unit for at least 3 years.So I detected internal (and external) mold (or fungus?). No I didn't pull the machine apart, I ran 1 gallon of white vinegar through it and soaked all the parts in it too, but then the mold that died and was flaking off was doing it in bucketfuls, especially from inside the unit. I was an idiot to think I'd get it all out. When I got it to the point that no more was coming out, I used the unit and it was fine. The next day when we went to use the unit, it just would not work. The switch on the handle was shot from the rigorous cleaning it got and quite honestly, I wasn't sure if the mold/fungus was 100% out of the inside of the unit, so I was happy to replace it.I replaced it with Waterpik's latest model, the WP-100, which touts to have the same water capacity, measured in seconds as the WP-65, which is definitely not the case and clearly a marketing deception as the capacity is listed as 900s, as in 900 seconds each tankful. The graph provided on Amazon's WP-100 page shows the 900s for the WP-60 and WP-100, but when you look at the milliliters listed immediately under the 900s, you see the big difference of 650mL for the WP-100 vs. 1000mL for the WP-60 (the WP-60 is similar to the WP-65 which is what I buy from Amazon). That's a huge difference in water capacity and I didn't realize what I was in for. When the new one arrived I was excited to get started with it because of a few new features. OMG, within 5 days of using it, I hated it because:WP-100 CONS:1. the rubber feet would not stick to the countertop surface and the damn thing slid all around while trying to set up, clean teeth, and then clean and dry the unit.2. You need 2 hands to turn off this stupid thing because it slides all over the place. Why is that a pain? Because you aren't ready to let go of the handle because you are going to refill the well whether to rinse out the unit or to continue a needed second round of waterpik'ing because you have braces or something similar.3. the water capacity is in no way, shape, or literally form the same as this unit. I had to refill the new WP-100's water container twice (I have braces) to get the job done and this was not an easy task because you can't turn the unit off with one hand anymore, no matter how you try to turn the unit off just to refill it, it slides all around the place. You need 2 hands. I always had to put the handle down to refill despite that I had a huge glass of warm water with mouthwash already prepared to be dumped and no matter what I did with all the sliding and things I was trying to hold, the second refill always spilled outside the more narrow water well (more narrow than the WP-65) making a big mess to clean on the countertop now too in addition to everything else.So I had it by the 5th day of using the WP-100, contacted Amazon who accepted it back without a problem as I exchanged it for a new WP-65. Oh, the joy!!! So easy to use; no chasing the unit around the counter top, one handed turn on and turn off, a water capacity that easily holds enough water to do my full mouth of braces.To all who are looking to buy, here's the pros and cons:1. I hate flossing because my teeth are so tightly packed together and I hate that the floss cuts off the circulation to my fingers. Yes, I know about the preflossed tooth piks. I keep them with me, but they can't wrap around your teeth like floss can. I was loosing the dental hygiene battle because I could not tolerate flossing, so I barely remembered to do it.2. I don't care what all the reports say that flossing is better. It is not if you are a person like me who despises flossing to the point of not doing it. The Waterpik blasts debris out from everywhere (use a weaker flow over bridge-work and things like that), even at the gum line in front and back of the teeth that the floss can't touch and the toothbrush may be missing. When I started using the Waterpik, I started winning the war against cavities and my gums went from that reddish-pink that bleeds while flossing, which means bacteria has inflamed your gums and are eating away at your teeth, to a nice and healthy whitish-pink and absolutely no bleeding, even at the dentist's office when they try to make them bleed! My dentist says I am one of his top patients in oral hygiene, so take that all you stupid reports! They neglect to add to the report how people feel about flossing. Some are great with it, many are like me and can't stand it.3. I love how clean my teeth feel after Waterpik'ing and then brushing. 'Smack'n them germs to the ground! :-)The con (I consider this to be one big flaw: mold/fungus):With all the Waterpik's we've owned, 3 WP-65's and 1 WP-100, we've learn each time something new about it.- First it was, you have to flush the mouthwash out of it (not doing that killed our first unit).- The second time it was, mold (or fungus? or both?) WILL grow inside the unit, despite religiously flushing the mouthwash out every single time with plain tap water. The mold or fungus is hideously unhealthy and will clog the unit too (water coming from under the waterpik onto your countertop and the handle at the same time is a hint you have a clog starting). I broke our unit trying to get the mold out, but like I said, it was best, health-wise, to not kid myself that I would get rid of all  the mold inside that machine and just kick it to the curb.- Now it is the third time around, we know we have to battle the bacteria, mold, and fungus and I have done my homework. Hydrogen Peroxide kills bacteria, fungus, and mold and is safe to use internally as a mouth rinse. It is also used to clean surfaces to a squeaky clean, so it doesn't leave residue behind. I use a 80/20 solution: 80% water, 20% Hydrogen Peroxide at 3% strength. I first pour that into the water well, then I Waterpik my teeth with it which is simultaneously cleaning my teeth and the inside of the machine with it. After the flush is done, I lay the handle pointing downwards in the sink to let the water drain out of the unit. After the 80/20 solution has dripped out of the unit, I keep a special set of towels to clean and dry the whole unit. First I wet the towel with the Hydrogen Peroxide (think of it like it is soap), and I wipe down everything with it: the water well, all the nicks and crannies of the base unit, the tip I used, the on/off switch, the cut outs in the base to hold the tips and the handle and the handle. Then I use the other side of the towel to dry it all up.Is this worth it? Heck yes. My husband who wouldn't use the unit just got a bridge that cost us well over $3000 out of pocket. He now uses this Waterpik which costs $39.99 on Amazon, but I used my Amazon reward points and got it for less than a dollar. Still $39.99 &lt;&lt;&lt; $3000!Oh, one more con which dentists and orthodontists discourage using the Waterpik, but I don't know if they know Waterpik solved the problem: dentists and orthodontists say the Waterpik is not for braces or bridges. Well, they need to catch up with the times. Waterpik does make a tip for braces and a tip for bridges. These tips are not available for the WP-65, but are for the traveling Waterpik and we'd take these tips with us if we traveled anyway. So yes, I set up 2 Waterpiks everyday and so does my husband. No, it is not a big deal to do this and I promise you, both of us would not be flossing without them.I got the specialized tips for use with the traveling Waterpik when I purchased the traveling case that holds the tips. They sell that case 2 ways, one empty and one populated with the different tips. I bought the tip populated case for traveling. It is a easy and hygienic way to bring the tips along with you. You don't have to gather up all the tips you need, find some container to put the in, and then remember to put the tips in the container. All the tips are already altogether in the case. Our case stays on our countertop for ease of access to the bridge and orthodontic tips.For those who don't mind chasing the WP-100 around the countertop and fumbling around to turn it on and off, and yes, this is a Pro for the WP-100, I believe it comes with the special tips automatically.Update 2/27/2014: I no longer wear braces, well except for the permanent wire along the back of my lower teeth. I use the regular WP-65 tips for them without a problem and the hygienist mentioned that I keep that wire all-around cleaner than any of their patients. My dentist recommended that I back down from a 50%/50% water-to-hygrogen peroxide solution to a 80%/20% solution as he said that should be enough to do the job and I am just wasting all the rest (i.e., the other 30% of the Hydrogen peroxide solution). He's correct. I had a great check up even at that weaker solution.The most important update: The WP-65 with the hydrogen peroxide solution remains mold free and we've owned it just about 10 months now. Healthier for us and our teeth.One word to Waterpik:Please, Please, Please do something ""official"" about the mold/fungus issue. Either issue a statement about how to keep the units mold/fungus free or come out with a Waterpik ""cleaner"" that meets our warranty needs and destroys these critters at the same time.

I wore those things for a long time, always making sure any footwear would accommodate them before buying.About three years ago I decided to go to a specialized shoe store for a pair of trail/running shoes.  I pulled out the orthodics and I thought the sales person would die laughing.  She asked me how long I had them and I told her and she said they were way too small for my current foot.  I knew they were cutting into the bottom of my foot a bit but I didn't know then that your feet expand as you age and if you gain weight.  She told me about these inserts and I bought a pair for the New Balance Gore-tex hiking/trail shoes I bought.  I could tell the difference instantly - these cover the whole sole of the foot where the doctor made orthodics only went from the heel to the ball of the foot.  These orthodics proved to be better than the ones I had done with the doctor.Now I never buy a pair of shoes without using them.  They last forever (haven't replaced any yet) and pretty much all shoes have a removable insole.  You take that out, put these in, and they provide better support/correction than the doctor ones, in my opinion.  Not to mention you save about $450.00.I have worn out shoes, but never one of these.

206430,AQM0K7MBBT4AY,B003UKKHB4,B. Rose,0,0,"&lt;&lt;UPDATE: I've been using this toothbrush for a month or so, and recently realized... my teeth have ACTUALLY GOTTEN NOTICEABLY WHITER. The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.>>I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn't seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.I went to Target and bought their generic 'Up & Up' brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order & review it.The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic 'Up & Up' model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you're brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I'm distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.Another nice feature is the 'timer' function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as many of us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit's battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn't notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up & Up toothbrush which, though it claims it'll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.I've been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won't come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven't made use of the different brushing modes, but I'm sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth & gums, the unit pays for itself handily.

I shaved with it very carefully on three separate occasions, and I finally gave up in disgust and threw the product away.I usually shave with a two bladed razor, but have also used the Mach 3 Turbo in the past, which I think works fine.  This five blade razor, however, just didn't work for me.  The first time I tried I had to shave twice to even cut the hairs... I thought I must have been doing something wrong -the angle of the shave seemed strange and the razor seemed to glide across my face, but didn't trim any stubble.  Fine, I thought, I must have been holding it wrong --I'll try again.Well, during my second attempt (on a different day) I held the blade at a much greater angle than I usually do... I really tried to shave the way I thought the makers intended.  Still no luck.  I had to shave everything again to get all the spots I missed, but I STILL was left with patches on my neck.  And this time I cut myself twice...Ok, I thought, I'll give it one more go.  The third time was the last straw.  I cut myself again and I received a really patchy shave on my neck (where my stubble seems to grow in different directions...), which required me to go over the bad spots again with my regular razor.  I then threw out the razor and the spare blade in disgust.Why, however, did I give it two stars instead of one? Well, I did that because it SEEMED high quality, and the materials, at least, were sound.  I just can't for the life of me figure out how to get a better shave with this razor than I did with my Gilette Comfort Plus, or the Mach 3 turbo.

You might find this a little silly, but in the end it's no sillier or more normal than choosing any other hair style or face style. If you enjoy having the James Bond five o'clock shadow stubble beard look, then this would be the device to help you maintain that level.This works the same way an eyebrow trimmer does. You have the trimmer part, and then a comb that sets the height of the hair. To be more precise, it is exactly a beard trimmer.It's first setting - the smallest one - gives you a stubble. The second one maybe does. By the third setting you're at ""normal"" beard or mustache trimming lengths. There are settings out past a half inch. I'm not sure how that qualifies as stubble. From that perspective, this is really just a beard trimmer that does have a ""stubble"" setting at its lowest point.Item 2. The unit is fairly large. If you're trying to keep some facial hair and stubble the rest, it's hard to detail with it. The blades are fairly deep in the unit, making it hard to make an edge. The only way to edge is to remove the whole outside part and edge with the naked blade. The plastic blade ""bounces"" in and out away from the blade area which doesn't seem to be useful or helpful at all. It seems to gather a lot of hair inside the unit when it trims, rather than letting it fall into the sink. I would count that as ""bad"" in terms of that area filling up.It does clean very easily because the entire top unit is press-fit into the main unit. It comes with a little brush. Most units of this type come with a little tube of oil. This one doesn't - but maybe long term it doesn't need one? Or do they assume you'll buy some of your own?We have other beard trimmers which can do stubble and which work much better than this unit. If anything, this might be useful for someone looking for a crew cut - set it to notch 4 or 5 and run it over your entire head.For charging there is a cord you plug into a wall, which you can detach from the hand held unit part.This really seems to be a beard trimmer with a new, trendy name.

Since then, anything with fish ingredients (even a restaurant-made Caesar dressing) makes her sick.But because I am willing to do whatever it takes for my wife and future child, I wanted the best dang supplements I could buy. Of all the places near me after our doctor appointment, I ended up going to Whole Foods for our initial batch of DHA supplements. While I normally don't shop at Whole Foods, I do agree that if anyone wanted healthy products backed by a company with a healthy philosophy, they should shop there. To my surprise, the *ONLY* DHA supplement they have without any fish-based ingredients was this brand. So with that said, I ended up buying it.Surprisingly this supplement doesn't make my wife sick whatsoever. What's even more surprising is that despite the directions, she can eat these on an EMPTY STOMACH with no adverse reaction! She's been taking theNew Chapter Perfect Prenatal, 192 Countvitamin and this product and has no nausea.  We ran out of our initial batch a little over 2 months ago and when it came time to restock, we were to see that Amazon carried these and they were several dollars cheaper than Whole Foods' price.Can't recommend these enough.",5.0,"Excellent DHA Pills - No Fish, No Nausea - My Wife Loves Them",1380067200,"09 25, 2013"

111448,A3LMTYCFNXKS96,B0017OCDJO,Carolyn,58,58,"I had used Prilosec for a few years. Both OTC and prescription. Yes it does stop heartburn and acid reflux, but at a very high price. Many side effects are never even listed. You must do research to find them. I was losing excessive amounts of hair, sometimes by the handful. I developed right hip pain. The worst side effect was the depression. Sometimes for several weeks, other times for only a few days. After some simple research you can find that these and a few others are very common for people taking this type of drug. I like my hair, hated the pain in my hip and my husband was worried about the depression as was I. One article I read mentioned Zinc Carnosine and the Japanesse study. After a little more research I decided to try it.The first two weeks were a struggle,frequent heartburn and the withdrawal of the Prilosec. Things begin improving the third week. I found taking the Zinc with meals worked much better for me, morning and evening. The four and fifth week I had only occassional heartburn. My husband committed on how much better I appeared to be feeling and I was. My hair had stopped coming out by the handfulls and I had no periods of depression, pain in my hip was much less now. Prilosec inhibits absorption of calcium by the way. Opps, something else they never mention! I had some breakthrough heartburn the last two weeks. I was worried that the Zinc may not work for long. I cut back on the amount of milk I was drinking since dairy products require twice as much stomach acid to digest them. I have been heartburn free for two weeks after completing the eight weeks of zinc therapy. If it should return I will use the Zinc Carnosine again over Prilosec or any other form of the drug. It works.I think lots of people tend to overtlook the fact that over the counter drugs are still just that, DRUGS. All side effects are rarely listed. If there is a natural way to treat a disease, you should have that choice offered at the same time as a prescription treatment. In our system of healthcare, or lack of, money is and always will be MOST doctors main concern. Be it by returning visits or a bonus for writing x number of prescriptions.

The brush was soon used to the point of uselessness, but I used the floss holder for years.  Eventually the plastic broke, after a couple of decades of use.  When I went to buy another, to my dismay there were none to be found.  The floss holders for sale at the local drugstores seemed to be made for people with tiny hands and perfect teeth.  They were more like doll toys.  Many were disposable or only used proprietary dental floss sources.  I gave up and went to a water pick, which is fine most of the time but sometimes just can't get at stubborn bits of food stuck between my molars.  I was sometimes reduced to using sharp tweezers to remove those bits of fiber.This tool is large enough for me to grasp firmly so that I can jam the floss into the tight gaps between my back teeth.  It is long enough that I don't have to have my hand all the way in my mouth to reach those teeth.  It uses generic floss.  It does have one weakness.  If you only wrap the floss around the knob provided for that purpose, it won't stay tight on the tool if you need to apply a lot of pressure to it.  But you can wrap it around the knob, then around the handle, and then around the knob again, and it will stay.

A few things I loved about the Norelco kids clipper - it comes with a great apron that helps keep the cut hair off your child, making clean-up much easier when you have a kid who barely sits still long enough for you to cut their hair in the first place.  Another plus - the clipper guides - they are easy to use/adjust, they are slightly flexible which makes cutting a little easier, and the edges are rounded, which reduces the ability of poking an ear or other facial feature.  Finally, the clipper itself is great - it is a good size to hold in your hand, is lightweight, has the ability of being charged ahead of time for cordless use, or use with a cord for use any time.

Unfortunately, I also have an auto-inflammatory disease that caused a cyst to grow in one of the breaks rather than new bone. Once that cysts was removed there was significant loss of bone and I had to have a bone implant. It was as if I'd been given a trip to hell.

244117,AARHLUIV2NNI2,B0055CMKTC,William Bagley,3,3,"I have been very happy with the Nutrigold products and have been selecting a lot of them from the Vine review list.  The two main reasons have been that the company has made an effort to get approval for the ""non-GMO verified"" tag to get put on their product and also they have a lot of products that are in vegan capsules.  Since I have a vegan diet, I appreciate both these gestures a lot.  In the company write up, they share that their Maca is ""Maca Gold is also independently certified by a third-party lab to be free of soy, milk, wheat, gluten, eggs, and shellfish.""  This fits the non-GMO label.  I like the commitment to third party testing.  It also signals to me that the company has a commitment to a certain standard.  There are a lot of products that I would not take that fall below this.As far as the Maca itself goes, there is a summary write up I found useful in the company literature:  ""Maca has been an important traditional food and medicinal plant for over 2000 years. Although Maca is unrelated to the ginseng family, it has been dubbed Peruvian ginseng because it is often used as a folk remedy to enhance stamina, energy, and sexual function. Maca is naturally rich in essential minerals, especially selenium, calcium, magnesium, and iron, and fatty acids including linolenic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acids, and 19 amino acids, as well as polysaccharides. Maca's reported benefits for sexual vigor and health could be due to its high concentration of proteins and vital nutrients and the root's unique nutritional profile, which provides optimum levels of nutrients utilized by the body's endocrine system without adversely impacting hormone levels.""  I found this paragraph to pretty much sum up the research on Maca.I have been taking a lot of herbs as part of my health and longevity program.  To be honest, Maca was one that I was going to take off my list.  I had bought the Maca powder from the health food store (and a health food section of a coop) twice and could not feel much happening for me with it.  I do not think that it means that the herb is bad or that its claims are off, but just that the herb does not address my own biochemical individuality and needs.  But since I have been very happy with the products from this company, I decided to give Maca another try.  This is the first Maca supplement that I can actually feel something from.  It feels like a little extra energy boost.  Nothing too big or too grand, but noticeable, enough for me to want to continue to explore this product.  I will update if I notice anything else.  I do not have a theory about why this product allowed me to feel something and the other Maca did not, even when I took some fairly large doses of the other ones.  I have gathered that some herbs lose some of their potency when they meet the stomach acids, and the capsule form may bypass it.  It could also be that the powder form of Maca I took before, from two locations, were in the bins too long and lost their potency by getting oxidized.  Or it could be that my body is in a different place and can benefit more from it now (I had some dental work recently).  I would suspect that other sources of Maca are probably very good too.  But it does seem like this product works.

I had tried nearly everything; but I just could not find a product that gave me the benefits I was looking for without the tradeoff of a handful of unwanted ones.  A friend told me about Full Time Energy amino acid powder, and I got a little curious.  I started using this powder about a month ago; and let me tell you, it has changed my life for the better.Not only am I able to do the things I want to do, but I have that energy without feeling jittery and uneasy.  This powder is fortified with Acai berry, Goji, and Mangosteen, three ingredients that are found in some of the healthiest foods on the market.  This was huge selling point for me; but the real convincing happened when I started supplementing Full Time Energy powder into my daily routine.I liked to take my supplement with juice, but you can take it with water as well.  In fact, I have now gotten into the habit of turning into a delicious, healthy smoothie that I drink before I exercise.  I am able to carry on with my workout, never feeling the sting of fatigue until I have been working for a long time.  Indeed, I often leave the gym still full of robust energy.I simply pour myself a glass of juice and add the powder.  I use one tablespoon per 20 ounces of water.  Sometimes, I dilute it down with 32 ounces of water, but I get great results either way.  I mix these ingredients together quickly and down the drink, always on an empty stomach.  Luckily, Full Time Energy is nothing like the other products I have tried, leaving me feeling horrible after I take them with no food in my belly.In fact, the Full Time Energy powder actually contains P.E.A. (phenyl ethylamine).  This substance is something that is found naturally in the body.  Studies have actually shown that people with high levels of P.E.A. in their systems show improved mood.  That's right; Full Time Energy powder will actually help you with things like fatigue, depression, and insomnia over time.  I know that, personally, I have been sleeping much better at night and feeling much more confident during the day.  However, this may have a lot to do with the great weight loss results I am seeing as well.All-in-all, I would say that this product is something that I would recommend to anyone who is struggling with their energy levels, fat loss issues, or weight loss problems.  Incorporating this product into your every day routine is a great idea for anyone, not just those who have body consciousness issues.

My wash room is in the center of my 1 story home and the dryer exhausts to the roof. After a blowing, I go outside and look at the lint on my roof shingles. Well, lately there hasn't been much lint blown onto the roof and the dryer was needing more than one cycle for all laundry types. To top that off, my last Progress Energy bill was $450.00...ouch! As soon as I got this in I followed the instructions for cleaning the tube from ""within"" the home and hooked up my shop vac and drill. I could not believe the amount of lint that was collected. No wonder my dryer could not breathe. Someone told me to be careful of the amount of soap I use as too much soap will cause excessive lint. I have been careful with the detergent measurements, but to no avail. This is great and fairly easy to use.

Hopefully this review will help others with unsightly nasal hair growth. So here goes...I received this little trimmer last week and I'm impressed with it.  I've owned several nose hair trimmers over the years. A year or so ago I purchased a Wahl trimmer:Wahl 5567-200 Ear Nose and Brow Dual Head Trimmerfrom Amazon. It worked okay, but it left a lot of noticeable hair behind. It never seemed to get it all, and I'm talking about some visible hair, not just out-of-reach, hidden growth.  I was never able to manipulate the thing to get it all. Believe me, I tried, and I was using it nightly in the hope that regular use would eventually take care of the problem.I decided to try this trimmer based on the reviews. I'm so glad I did.  It's just about perfect. I'm amazed at how much better it worked. I could immediately hear it clipping hair. No more visible growth peeking out, but better yet, everything ""up there"" felt smooth and clean. Nice!  Now, it's not perfect. I'm sure there's a little stubble somewhere, but next to filling my nose with Nair, I think that this is the best that it's going to get.  I generally use it daily or every other day, just to keep on top of the situation. The little LED light is handy if you want to take a quick peek up there to see if everything looks clean.It would be better if it had a rechargeable battery, but I'll put up with battery replacement because it works so well. Some reviewers had a problem with the on/off switch. This has not been an issue for me so far, so I assume the problem has been fixed.  Nevertheless, the company appeared to resolve the issue with people who experienced the problem, so I wasn't worried about getting stuck with a lemon.

I feel totally normal, refreshed, well rested in the morning.overall the combination of the magnesium, vitamin D3 I feel more balanced, as i am not on any medications , I hesitated for a long time before committing to taking any tablets , especially long term, but this experience changed my mind.I may try the time release version of the melatonin next time, just to see the difference, and if I maybe even will stay asleep with them.",5.0,Works,1327190400,"01 22, 2012"

Subsequent repair and rehab have left my knee to be less than 100%.I like this knee support for a number of reasons:1)  It's adjustable.  The straps will allow this support to custom fit a wide variety of knee/leg sizes comfortably.  While it's a one-size-fits-most support, do make sure to measure your thigh 3-inches above your kneecap.  If your thigh is more than 22"", this support will be very tight (or just won't fit).2)  It breathes very well.  I'm a gifted perspirer.  This support somehow doesn't get soaked.3)  Not stinky.  (See #2 above.)4)  It's very comfortable.  The ""Comfort Sleeve"":  This little innovation consists of a very thin sheath you slide your leg into prior to adjusting the straps.  It's like the same material used to make biker shorts, only thinner.  This helps hold the brace in place without pulling or tugging on your leg hair.  It also makes the brace feel very snug and comfortable.  I love it.  I found it comfortable enough to wear for daily use (home and office) as well as during workouts.As you may have deduced from my title, I have one misgiving about the comfort sleeve:  It doesn't appear to be very strong.  The stitching started to come loose on my very first wear.  I've worn this brace over ten times now and the stich-tearing appears to have stopped.  It just doesn't increase my confidence in the overall integrity of the comfort sleeve (and therefore the loss of one-star).All in all, if you need mild to moderate support for your knee as a result of arthritis or joint strains, this is a great choice.",4.0,Comfort sleeve: Brilliant!

I find this newer model an improvement on the older in many ways.  The brush head has been redesigned; its contours are more ergonomic, more comfortable and with better reach. The handle is also slimmer, and easier to get my small hand around.  It does seem to get my teeth cleaner, removing many stains, red wine, etc., faster than the earlier model did; the manufacturer states this new patented sonic technology delivers 31,000 brush strokes per minute. It offers a quadpacer & smartimer mode, each encouraging attentive brushing and reinforcing a recommended brushing time of at least two minutes. It has a recharge indicator that blinks to remind you when to recharge, and charges faster than the older model. Also, they have combined the older model&#8217;s charger and holder; plus the new charger&#8217;s footprint is smaller, so it takes up noticeably less of the valuable space on my crowded bathroom counter.

I have done my research and sampled many bars out there, but keep coming back to these Pumpkin bars. Why? Well, the flavor is better than most. The can be slightly dry so I suggest having something to drink on hand, but otherwise they are a pleasure to eat and are VERY filling. At 440 calories each, they better be! I usually eat half a bar as a snack or use it as a meal replacement, so the calories are not a big worry. What is great is that they are formulated to have minimal impact on your blood sugar so they actually help curb your hunger and maintain a good level of energy--thus helping you lose weight and maintain lean muscle mass, if that is what you are after. They contain fats, but they are the right fats, and in the proper ratio to protein for optimal assimilation by the body. The Pumpkin flavor actually has the healthiest combination of ingredients of all the Zero Impact bars and in my opinion, the best flavor.I am currently taking part in a ""Biggest Loser"" competition at my workplace. I've started exercising more and modified my diet, making these Pumpkin Bars an integral part of it. We've just completed the third week and I'm currently in the lead with just over 12 pounds lost, almost 6% of my total body weight. I wouldn't say I am (or was) overweight, but I could stand to drop some belly and love handle fat. Obviously all of this loss is not due to the Zero Impact bars, but I'm certain they are helping. For anyone looking to lose weight or gain lean muscle, you have nothing to lose by incorporating these into your diet. Buy a box and the per-bar breakdown is just over two dollars. That's really not bad if you think of what you would pay for a healthy meal.

She found a 150-dose bottle of the Natrol 5-HTP at our local Costco warehouse store and picked it up just for a try. She reported that they indeed enhanced her mood. She suggested that I try them, since I'm chronically bothered by somewhat depressed moods. I was skeptical, as I am of most miracle supplements and I've never had much luck with anti-depressants. Okay, I took them for a few days. Surprisingly, I found that my mood did indeed improve somewhat. It was no miracle, but my mood was better.Then, I made an interesting discovery. My appetite was significantly reduced. In fact, I forgot to eat my evening meal one night. Amazing! Well, it says right on the package that they help control appetite. Hmmmmm. And I was thinking of a diet to lose weight. This was exactly what I needed! f These things seem to both lift the mood and decrease the appetite. That's a nice combination of effects.Alas, the bottle ran out and I stopped taking them. There were no ill effects in stopping, I sould add. Then late this fall I found myself slipping into another seasonal depression. It's an annual thing for me. I remembered the Natrol 5-HTP caps and searched for a new supply. I could only find a 150 tablet bottle, but that's fine for my needs.You might note that these mood enhancers are dietary supplements rather than drugs, but it says that they may interfere with drugs or react with alcohol, so take care.

If you want to pay more for using a CoQ10 supplement that uses Ubiquinol instead, Nutrigold has a different product that does contain this supplement formulation, at a correspondingly higher price, naturally.This is a fine product and a good value. It isn't the best CoQ10 supplement that Nutrigold makes, but it is certainly far more effective than most of the CoQ10 supplements that you will find at your local drug store or supermarket and generally less expensive as well.",4.0,You Get What You Pay For,1391817600,"02 8, 2014"

85951,AI0BCEWRE04G0,B000VRSR84,Stoney,21,30,"Pure Stevia tastes like to sugar.  No aftertaste, no residue.  What more could you ask for?A TRUE REPLACEMENTAfter 60 years, I've broken my sugar addiction. Before pure Stevia, I used Splenda and later Truvia/Purevia (Stevia cut with bulking agents) for several years. The Truvia/Purevia were better than Splenda, but both the Splenda and Truvia/Purevia left disgusting residues and just didn't taste right (because of the fillers or bulking agents added).  More importantly for me, I could not fully enjoy my gourmet coffee with either. When I first began using pure Stevia, I appreciated the better flavor and lack of a residue, but it still did not taste quite like sugar to me. However, after 6 months of pure Stevia, it tastes like sugar to me, and I am again enjoying gourmet coffee.Perhaps more precisely, pure stevia is ""as effective"" as sugar for ""cutting the edge"" of bitter or sour drinks and foods---the way most people use sugar.  However, it is not as intensely sugary-sweet, regardless of how much you use. For a rare, once-a-month ""desert"" cup of fine coffee, I still use real sugar and real cream.  However, at least for my tastes, Splenda tastes better in lemonade than stevia.COMPARISON TO SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDERSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER contains the natural fiber Inulin as a bulking agent. KAL STEVIA POWDER does not. The Inulin does not seem to affect the flavor nor leave a yucky residue (as do the nasty bulking agents in Truvia/Purevia). Possibly due to the Inulin, SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier thand KAL STEVIA POWDER.SweetLeaf Stevia Powder, 4-Ounce Shaker Jars (Pack of 2)MEASUREMENTOne ""tiny spoon"" (included) of KAL STEVIA POWDER = 1 teaspoon of surgar.  1 level teaspoon of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER = a moderately heaping teaspoon of sugar.CAUTIONInulin is a polysaccaride sometimes used as a sugar substitute itself (for diabetics). It has about 1/4 to 1/3 the sweetness of sugar, and about 1/4 to 1/3 the caloric content---which I interpret to mean the same calories for the same sweetness (however, in this case much of the sweetness is contributed by the Stevia). Inulin is a current food fad, with the usual (probably greatly exaggerated) claims of benefits, including improving digestion, reducing cholesterol, particularly triglycerides, protection from intestinal cancer, etc. On the other hand, it causes digestive problems in some people. I suggest reading the Wikipedia article. If (like me), you don't have digestive problems with inulin, and it sounds as though the various benefits may be significant for your particular health problems---I suggest arranging for blood tests after a month of using inulin, and a month after not using inulin to compare. I plan to do this.EASE OF USESWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER and KAL LIQUID STEVIA are easier to measure than KAL STEVIA POWDER, because the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated. However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER comes with a tiny spoon which I find works perfectly well for measuring stevia for my coffee.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is so concentrated that it is difficult to evenly sprinkle over a sliced fruit dish.Pure Stevia Liquid Extract - 4 oz - LiquidSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier than KAL STEVIA POWDER. That is not a problem for hot drinks, but SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER or KAL LIQUID are preferable for cold drinks, such as iced tea or limonade. I also find that unsweetened fruit cups etc. are just too sour for my taste---a few drops of the KAL LIQUID STEVIA makes them perfect.ECONOMY$15.22 for 2 4oz bottles of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER versus $18.44 for 1 3.5 oz of KAL STEVIA POWDER (the price at the time of this writing, both with free shipping on orders >$25) may seem a bargain, but the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated. A 3.5oz jar of KAL STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 2381 servings. A 4oz bottle of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 230 servings (= 460 servings for 2 bottles). The economy of KAL LIQUID is probably similar to SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER.I use ""3 servings"" per mug of strong coffee, so 1 bottle (3.5oz) of KAL STEVIA POWDER = 600 mugs of coffee, to my taste; while 2 bottles (8 oz) of SWEETLEAF STEVIA = 153 mugs of coffee. So, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is clearly the winner for pure economy, but even the SWEETLEAF STEVIA is far cheaper and superior to Truvia/Purevia.CONCLUSIONFor coffee and other hot drinks, KAL POWDER is the most economical. For cold drinks, fruit etc. SWEETLEAF POWDER (or KAL LIQUID) is more convenient.General Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.

I typically buy generic storebrand, but when I had the chance to try Slim Fast, I wondered how the two would compare.  The results were quite surprising.Both the Slim Fast and the store brand (Kroger Stores) offered 10g of protein and 5g of dietary fiber.  But that's where the similarity ended. The store brand was bigger offering 325mL as opposed to SF's 295 mL.  Yet the store brand had 10 fewer calories and only 0.5 saturated fat (compared to SF's 1.5).  Slim Fast also had twice the cholesterol. But most shocking was the ingredients list. I was very surprised to see hydrogenated oil (trans fat) in Slim Fast.  How can a weight management drink contain trans fat of any sort? It is nowhere to be found on the store brand.  Granted, there's not enough hydrogenated oil to warrant a posting on the nutritional facts, but even small amounts can be harmful, especially if you drink one of these every day.As far as a taste comparison, I found little difference. Perhaps the Slim Fast was a bit creamier, but both of them tasted about the same.

That style had been discontinued so I replaced it with a Soft Perfection (20 tweezers) only to then learn of the X'elle which had 40.  So I bought an X'elle - aqua blue sparkly body.  The head, without the attachments, looked kind of naked and unfinished compared to the Soft Perfection and the tweezers were half plastic, half metal vs. metal on metal like the Soft Perfection - but it worked well.  I had some doubts of it holding up but it has held up fine over the last 4 years or so.  I am in need of a new replacement head - I think they ALL lose tweeze ability over time - and decided just to buy a whole new unit since they are making a new style now so the old is cheap.I may end up trying the new style down the road just because I like gadgets...  but since I tend to be crotchety and stuck in my ways I for now am going to say I prefer the old.  ;-)  As far as I can tell they use the same head so tweezing ability should be the same.  The new one just pivots which seems to me like it would offer less control?  I love the colorful, sparkly look of the old - the new looks boring.I keep wanting to try an Emjoi but I can't help but think that second spinning backward head, if it does anything, is going to break hair rather than help...Anyway.  Let's talk epilating.  Chances are if you are considering epilating, you are doing it because shaving doesn't cut it for you.  I am a hairy woman.  I blame PCOS + my mother's Italian genes.  Genetics has been cruel in that my brother and father have less leg hair than I do - on what planet is that fair???  So assuming you are coming at this from a similar place, you may never look like the woman on the box.  Your legs may also never feel as smooth with epilating as after shaving - but they will LOOK acceptable for much longer.  I can epilate and then go camping for a few days with friends and look OK - just don't touch me -vs shaving and I will look like a neanderthal in 8 hours.My experience is this works great on coarse hair, fairly well on medium hair, not so great on fine hair.  It will grab hair that is pretty short - way shorter than waxing - but the thicker the hair the less prone to breakage.So this works well on my lower legs (coarse).  Fairly well on the fronts of my thighs (medium) and bikini region (coarse).  Also well on my face (a few coarse chinny chins).  There are parts of my inner legs kinds of above and below the knee where the hair is fine, doesn't work so well on this.  Luckily my arm hair is light and fine, if a tad long - I would never dream of using this on my arms.  And I do not do the backs of my thighs because the hair grows in nine million different directions and you really need to go the right direction to epilate.  I am simply not limber enough to be able to get close enough to figure out what I am doing back there.On coarse hair- this works well.  I have never seen 4 weeks of smoothness - I tend to do it every few days in the summer.  But it is still more effective than shaving. AmLactin lotion can help a lot with an ingrowns that result - or for an acute horrible patch of them, tend-skin or the home made alternative.  I think weather or not you get them is partly a personal variation and it's annoying if you do.  A good Veet now and then (which I do to take care of the backs of my thighs) also tend to free the ingrowns.  For a manual exfoliation I have found that better than any scrub or loofah etc IN the shower is AFTER a nice long shower, dry your legs very aggressively with a nice un-fabric-softened towel - you will see the skin roll off even if you just used scrubby gloves or whatever.  Then use lotion.Forget about the acessories - the massage thing gets in the way, the cooling glove is not needed (but is good for kid's boo boos)  Bare bones, unit and spinny head, yank those hairs.Is this device perfect?  No - but it fails because body hair is a tough enemy to beat.  It won't get ALL the hair and it can hurt until you get used to it.  But it does a great job on coarse hair and it has a real place in the hairy woman's arsenal.  I can't imagine much better short of laser becoming truly affordable.",5.0,"Great gadget, results will vary with skin and hair type",1343088000,"07 24, 2012"

However, the list price of nearly $100 is a bit ridiculous - at that price I'd rather buy the ingredients (in higher dosages) individually. Today I see the Amazon price at $45 with free shipping (prices fluctuate on Amazon), which I think is worth it. I would prefer to see the price point under $40, but I suppose the free shipping makes up for it.So about 10 years ago I lost nearly 100 pounds switching to a low carb diet, taking some of these supplements. I lost the weight following a fairly radical eating plan (under 20 carbs per day), and kept it off by cutting out processed foods, sugar, and wheat. (Basically, no pasta, no rice, only low carb breads, no sugar, no potatoes, and no fruit except for berries).These days, there are much better products available (including this one) which would have made it much easier back then! This product is designed to do multiple things at once - suppress appetite, speed up metabolism, burn glucose, help you feel full, etc (without caffeine or amphetamines). So while it's best to take it before you eat, it still has benefits no matter when you take it.In fact, I might recommend taking it before ""problem"" times (if you mindlessly munch on popcorn in the evenings, etc). Some people eat small meals but get most of their carbs & bad calories throughout the day.I would also add, I don't think this will do much for you unless you're committed to a low glucose diet. The primary goal of this supplement is maintain blood sugar levels & prevent spikes after eating. If you're going to eat a spaghetti dinner, or several slices of pizza in one sitting, you probably won't notice much difference. If you eat low GI foods, you will definitely notice a difference.For a weight loss approach by glucose level optimization, I also recommend White Kidney Bean Extract & Brown Seaweed Extract. However, perhaps the most powerful weight loss aid (and I'm disappointed it's not in this supplement) is Raspberry Ketones. They are more powerful as an appetite suppressant than any of the ingredients here, they help boost metabolism & burn fat, and they have additional benefits (like antioxidants).

If you also use normal brushes, or want an ultraviolet solution that is future-proof, you may want to look for larger and more universal alternatives.  If you don't have one of the listed products, there's no reason whatsoever to consider this as a germicidal solution.The negative reviews thus far have focused on what this product doesn't support.

It would be nice, for example, to be able to put various WaterPik heads inside -- but that's not what this product is about, not what it claims to be.When I consider it just as an accessory to the Sonicare and Oral-B products listed, I find little or nothing to complain about.  It has a small footprint, it's ready to go right out of the box, it actually helps reduce clutter around the sink for those who juggle more than one or two brush heads.  It's aesthetically pleasing in a clean minimalist sort of way, a proper counterpart to the design of the current Sonicare and Oral-B products.  It's also not a significant power hog, even during the 10 minute ultraviolet saturation cycle.What this (and others like it) endeavor to provide is peace of mind and basic protection against contamination.  Even the cleanest looking bathrooms can tell a different story exposed to a forensic-type black light.  Having a place to not only securely store brush heads, but also provide limited germicidal irradiation to the brush heads is, in my estimation, an entirely worthwhile and justifying end.

I like it so much that I bought one for my left wrist as well. Here is how I use the braces:1. I wear them fairly snugly while I type.2. When the wrist pain is bad, I wear them in bed.Here are pros about the braces:1. Super comfy micro-suede like fabric lining the braces. They don't make my hands sweat.2. The stiff portions are inside of the mesh fabric. The splints feel like they are plastic rather than metal. This allows for some movement.3. The fabric part that is between your thumb and fingers seems to be edged in something like neoprene. It doesn't rub your skin raw.4. Fairly durable. A few threads are starting to come loose.Cons:1.

Unbearable uterine pains, especially during intercourse (frustrated husband).  Nerve pain in tooth (I was blaming the dentist for doing bad work).  Insomnia for days.

Massive amounts of hairloss on scalp and eyebrows.  Severe dry skin, and skin darkening.  Dry, weak nails. Joint pain in fingers.

Here's a secret no one will tell you: It may very well work better than floss, but... you'll totally miss the search and kill mission of your floss and your gums, coming together to find the enemy in one, swift motion. You may keep flossing because you don't WANT to stop flossing. No one owns you. You do what you want.- It's a weapon. Your child wants to come into the bathroom and you're enjoying 45 seconds of peace and quiet? All you have to say is, &#34;The water pik is aimed at the door. I have about 11 seconds of cool, watery burst. Check yourself.&#34; They'll run! It works!- The charger charges it. (That seems redundant. Let me explain: The charger actually does what it's supposed to do.) In most electronics, this is a novel concept. (A bit like finding that elusive white squirrel in the backyard that you saw last week and now you can't find, but you're going to find it. BY GOD YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT.) The charger works for about 2 weeks. Enough said.- It holds water without leaking. See? Novel. It works like it's supposed to.- There are two levels: Deadly and Deadlier.  The first level is all like, &#34;I'm going to spray the *#$& out of your teeth.&#34; The second level is like, &#34;I'm going to spray the*#$& out of your teeth and then invite you over for pie.&#34; As you can imagine, that's awkward. So, I use the first level. No one wants to eat pie after they cleaned their teeth.Cons:- Be prepared to look like an idiot. you have to close your mouth. It'll fill up your mouth quite quickly, so you need to remember to spit often. (I swear on my Catholic upbringing, I do not mean this the way you think I mean this.)- You'll miss the minty-fresh taste of your flossIn conclusion, you should just buy it.",5.0,I'm an Olympic-style  water-pik-er.,1359676800,"02 1, 2013"

It would probably be alright if it fit better but it is way too big and loose.  I checked Shock Doctor's website before ordering to make sure I was getting the right size but it literally slides down while wearing it.
